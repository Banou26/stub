/**
 * The npm entry build, run after the app build and written beside it into `build/`.
 *
 * The platform loads an npm app by appending `<script type="module" src="<entry>">` to a sandbox
 * document, and the entry it reads is package.json's `main`. So the package has to ship a module that
 * mounts itself with no html around it, which `vp build` alone does not produce: that build's inputs
 * are index.html and embed.html, and its js is reachable only through them. anime.fkn.app serves
 * index.html and is unaffected either way, which is how 0.0.18 came to ship with no entry at all
 * while every check stayed green.
 *
 * Everything except the output shape is the app's, so the two builds cannot drift on aliases,
 * polyfills, `define` or dependency pre-bundling.
