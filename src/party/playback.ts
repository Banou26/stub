 * few seconds later. Running at NUDGE_RATE instead closes a quarter second in about five seconds,
 * inaudibly, and the follower ends up genuinely level rather than merely within tolerance.

 * few hundred milliseconds old is moved forward by that much, which is right whenever the clocks

 * smoothly, so a follower converges on the host rather than settling anywhere inside a tolerance
 * band. Under the floor it is left alone, since a correction that never stops is a stutter.
