/**
 * Every layer the app paints in the ROOT stacking context, in the order they stack.
 *
 * A z-index only means anything next to the others it competes with, so a number written on its own,
 * in the file that happens to need it, is not a decision anybody can check. Nine of them were, and on
 * 2026-09-09 three carried comments describing a header that had moved two days earlier: the account
 * menu still argued that staying under the modal was "correct rather than a compromise: the modal
 * covers the header, so the button cannot be open under it", which had inverted into a defence of the
 * exact bug it claimed was unreachable. The party menu, the account menu and the party chat all
 * opened UNDER the media modal, unclickable, and the click that missed them closed the show.
 *
 * So the order lives here, read as a list, and `tests/unit/components/layers.test.ts` refuses a raw
 * number anywhere in `src/`. Adding a popup means adding a line to this file, next to the layers it
 * has to beat, rather than picking a number that looks big enough.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS HERE is a layer that competes at the ROOT: something fixed, or portalled to the body,
 * or otherwise with no stacking context between it and the document. What does NOT is an ordering
 * inside one box, like a row's own overlay: those keep their own small numbers and are listed in the
 * test with the reason they are not page layers.
