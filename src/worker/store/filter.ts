/**
 * The medias an aggregated page should keep, given the filters the caller set.
 *
 * STRICT: a filter names values, and a row that cannot show it carries one of them does not match. A
 * media with no `type` fails a format filter, a media with no genres fails a genre filter. The
 * alternative, letting an absent field pass, means a "Movies" filter lists every row no source typed,
 * which is the failure a user reads as broken.
 *
 * Genres and tags are ALL-match, case-insensitively: adding a second genre narrows, which is what
 * every browse UI does and what a user adding one expects. Formats and categories are ANY-match,
 * because they are alternatives rather than refinements.
 *
 * `status` IS filtered here, and it could only become filterable once the home page stopped using it
 * to mean something else. That page asked for RELEASING to mean "the current season", every seasonal
 * source read it that way, and a listing of a season legitimately holds runs that have not aired yet,
 * so enforcing it would have emptied a third of the front page. The home page now names its season
 * (router/home/index.tsx), which leaves this free to mean what it says.
 *
 * It is strict like the rest, and that has a real cost worth knowing: the bundled offline catalogue
 * publishes no status at all, on purpose, because its dump's own value decays within weeks (192 of 219
 * SUMMER 2026 rows read UPCOMING in a dump cut six weeks before they aired). So a status filter drops
 * every row only that catalogue describes. That is the honest answer to "which of these is airing" and
 * it is why status is a filter rather than a default.
