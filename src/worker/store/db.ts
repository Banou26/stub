// IMDb `tt` id is the series, so every season of a show carries the same one and the claim is that
// they are all one media - which is what merged Mushoku Tensei's three seasons even after JustWatch,
// TMDB and TVmaze each stopped doing it, because five separate sources (tvmaze, trakt, simkl, omdb,
// watchmode) all emit it.
//
// TMDB and TVmaze could be scoped because both model seasons; IMDb does not, so there is no honest
// season id to mint and scoping would invent one that no source could independently reproduce.
//
// THAT WAY NOW EXISTS, so this no longer drops the handle. It first read as a DEMOTION: a SAME_AS for
// one of these origins was rewritten to PART_OF, which carries its url without asserting sameness.
// The comment that used to end here read "Until there is a way to attach a handle for its LINK
// without asserting identity, it is not linked at all. The cost is the IMDb link disappearing from
// the aggregated media." That cost is paid back by this line.
//
// Now it reads as a SCOPE: a uri of one of these origins is a CONTAINER, whatever row it arrived in,
// and `upsertMedia` derives the relation from the two scopes exactly as it does for a row a source
// stamped CONTAINER itself. Same outcome for a run's claim (an edge, never a union), and a claim from
// another container unions in the container space instead of being thrown away.
//
// It stays as a backstop rather than being deleted with the producers migrated: it is one Set lookup,
// and it means a source that starts emitting a bare imdb id again is corrected here instead of
// welding every season of a show.
