/**
 * What the BEST SOURCES say, with agreement breaking ties only among equals.
 *
 * The store's other resolutions take the highest-scored source's value and stop (`acc.x ?? gql.x` over
 * a score-sorted list), so one source outvotes any number of others however many agree with each
 * other. That is right for a title, where sources are spelling the same thing differently and the
 * best-scored spelling is simply the one to show. It is not enough for a NUMBER, where sources are
 * making a claim about the world and two equals agreeing is evidence the first one alone is not.
 *
 * SO THE TIERS ARE LEXICOGRAPHIC, NEVER ADDITIVE. The best score present decides which claims are
 * looked at; among those, the value the most of them claim wins; nothing below that tier is consulted
 * at all. A source cannot be outvoted by any number of sources beneath it.
 *
 * A SUM WAS TRIED FIRST AND IS WRONG, measured three ways on 2026-09-09:
 *
 *   Mushoku Tensei S1 part 1, once the streaming tier echoes Crunchyroll's packaging:
 *     24 scores cr 0.5 + jw 0.2 + nf 0.2 + appletv 0.2 + paramount 0.2 = 1.3
 *     11 scores mal 0.9 + kitsu 0.3                                    = 1.2
 *   and the sum publishes the folded 24, which is the defect it was written to stop. Five catalogues
 *   restating one packaging is one witness counted five times.
 *
 *   Mushoku Tensei season 3 while airing: mal and AniList publish the announced 14, and six sources
 *   publish `episodes.length`, the eleven aired so far. The sum goes 1.8 to 1.7 for 11.
 *
 *   Over the 100 cluster snapshot in dist-seed the sum was identical to today's rule in 100 of 100,
 *   so it bought nothing anywhere and lost in exactly the cases that matter.
 *
 * Tiers answer 11 and 14, correctly, in both.
 *
 * NOT the value times anything, in either shape. The owner's first sketch was `11 * 2 * 0.8 >
 * 24 * 1 * 0.6`, multiplying by the claim: that makes the larger number win for being larger, so a
 * lone folded season beats a lone catalogue every time. The claim is what is being voted ON.

 * Tensei season 1 as one season of 23 and a special where AniList and MAL split the same broadcast
 * into 11 and 12, so an 11 episode run listed 24 rows: 11 correct, then part 2's twelve, then the
 * special (measured on the live site 2026-09-09).

 * The rule is the one `sources/similar.ts` already applies when CHOOSING a season, moved to where the
 * choice is displayed: a member whose own count exceeds what the run's sources agree on is describing
 * a longer thing, and only the part of its list that fits the run is this run's.
 *
 * IT REFUSES A TAIL, NEVER A SOURCE. Crunchyroll's episodes 1 to 11 are still this run's episodes and
 * are still listed; a member that agrees about the length is untouched however low its score; and a
 * cluster whose sources publish no count at all is left exactly as it was, because there is nothing to
 * be wrong about. That last case is the reason this cannot be written as "drop what exceeds the
 * count": most of the store has no count.
