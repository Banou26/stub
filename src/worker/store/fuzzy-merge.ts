/**
 * How far apart two clusters may put a show's start before that reads as a DISAGREEMENT rather than

 *
 * 45 rather than 30, because of a coercion nothing in the payload flags. kitsu and jikan hand stub
 * whatever their API answers (kitsu/extractor.ts:135, jikan/extractor.ts:126) and both answer
 * `YYYY-MM-01` when only the month is known, so a first-of-month date is up to 30 days early and
 * reads as precise. The `startDay` guard below catches only the January ones. Measured, same anime,
 * a kitsu first-of-month the guard KEEPS against a day-precise AniList date: 198 pairs, 187 of them
 * within 30 days, exactly ONE in the 31 to 45 band a 30 day window would refuse (Aikodesho, 32 days,
 * AniList Fri, 02 Sep 1988 against kitsu 1988-08-01) and 10 beyond 45, which are real disagreements
 * no window should absorb.
 *
 * WHY 45 IS NOT CHOSEN ON THE RATIO, which is the trap this sweep sets. Printed by the probe below,
 * as (welds refused / correct merges lost / ratio), with the first-of-month guard this file ships:
 *
 *     30   84 / 101   0.83        90   65 / 41   1.59
 *     45   83 /  81   1.02       180   40 / 11   3.64
 *     60   77 /  68   1.13
 *
 * The ratio improves MONOTONICALLY as the window widens, so a reader optimising it picks 180 days.
 * That is exactly backwards: this rule exists to separate two seasons inside ONE calendar year, and
 * the owner's stated shape is season 1 in months 1 to 4 against season 2 in months 7 to 10, which is
 * about 180 days apart. A 180 day window ALLOWS the entire population the check was built for, and
 * scores a beautiful ratio by refusing almost nothing. Two consecutive cours sit about 91 days apart,
 * so the window has a hard ceiling well below that regardless of what the ratio says.
 *
 * So the ceiling is structural and the ratio only picks between the widths under it. 45 is the widest
 * that leaves a full month of clearance below a cour, and it is the constant crunchyroll/extractor.ts
 * already ships for the same question, which keeps one number in the codebase instead of two.

 * Three arms move when the ordering changes, over the manami database (41537 records, 2026-27), and
 * no rule wins all three, so the numbers rather than a principle decide it:
 *
 *   A  two different shows sharing one junk franchise label, does it survive the slice on BOTH sides
 *      and weld them ("Star"t and Agitation! both carry "irodorimidori"): 1547 pairs, lower is better
 *   B  one show reaching the store as two clusters holding overlapping subsets of one title pool, do
 *      they keep a title in common: 6502 cases, higher is better
 *   C  a ONE-title streaming cluster meeting a fat metadata cluster, is that title among the six:
 *      12399 cases, higher is better. This is JustWatch attaching to Mushoku Tensei.
 *
 *                       A weld     B split     C attach
 *     arrival order      64.5%       94.9%        56.0%     what this replaces
 *     title ascending    69.6%       99.9%        70.0%     what this is
 *     longest first      53.8%      100.0%        19.9%     best on A and unusable on C
 *     shortest first     82.7%      100.0%        98.7%     the control, and it inverts A as predicted
 *
 * So ordering by the title costs five points on A and buys five on B and fourteen on C. Both recall
 * arms rise for the same reason: an ordering applied identically to both sides cannot drop a title one
 * side keeps, which is exactly what arrival order was doing to one split cluster in twenty.
 *
 * Two things worth knowing before changing this again. Latin code points sort below CJK ones, so this
 * does hand a tie to the english titles, and the intuition that this starves the native title and
 * costs matches is measurably wrong: C rises, because a streaming catalogue lists in latin and the
 * native title is not what it is looked up by. And A is not really the slice's job. Relying on a random
 * six to drop a third of the wrong welds is relying on luck for correctness, and it is what made the
 * same two shows merge on one load and not the next. The 255 of those 1547 where exactly one side
 * names a season ("86" against "86 Part 2", both carrying "86 不存在的战区") are a veto gap, and closing
 * it was measured afterwards and does NOT pay A back: see the season check in sameShow for the numbers.

  // so an Apple cluster whose date is a late western release is refused against the metadata cluster.
  // It is NOT measured: over 398 sampled anime, Apple's search returned an item carrying a release
  // date for 199 of them and an item whose normalized title matched the query for ZERO, so the arm
  // cannot be measured from that endpoint at all and is recorded here rather than estimated.

  //   dramas, recaps, digest, ovas, omake, omakes, extra, extras, pilot, ex, short, shorts, preview,
  //   previews, pv). They are kept because a marker that fires zero times costs zero: the type
  //   disagreement has to hold first, so an unused marker cannot widen the rule on its own. The ten
  //   that do fire are led by "specials" at 22 and "special" at 10.
  //
  // The two are independent because a marker is how ONE catalogue writes a title and a type is what
  // BOTH catalogues assert about the work. A marker with no disagreement is a convention; a marker
  // with a disagreement is two catalogues independently saying these are different kinds of thing.
  //
  // MEASURED on the pool the start-date axis was decided on, main titles only (anilist
  // english/romaji/native at 0.8, kitsu titles.en/canonicalTitle/titles.ja_jp at 0.3), which is what
  // the extractors emit. Stub carries no synonyms anywhere; a title-plus-synonyms model inflates
  // every weld count severalfold and does not describe stub.
  //
  //   MARGINAL, not standalone, the same way the start-date block above is: that axis is already
  //   active when this runs, so these are what the companion check adds on top of it. Do not add the
  //   two sets of numbers together.

  //   residual  84 wrong welds and 15470 correct merges survive the 45 day axis
  //   benefit   49 of the 84 refused, every one a work against its own companion entry
  //   cost       2 of 15470 correct merges, both a real double disagreement: "Blade of the Immortal
  //               ONA" against kitsu's "Blade of the Immortal", anilist ONA against kitsu TV, and
  //               "Ghost Slayers Ayashi: Inferno OVA" against kitsu's title, anilist OVA against
  //               kitsu SPECIAL. 0 of 17946 streaming attaches, because a streaming catalogue fills
  //               no `type` at all and silence never blocks.
  //   robust    adding `offline` as a third typed member of every cluster, whose manami type differs
  //               from anilist's format 916 times in 17319 (5.29%), moves neither number: 49 and 2.
  //   replicate 895 same-year pairs selected instead by manami's own `related` graph, which never
  //               looks at a title: 80 weld with the date axis off, 14 survive it, 8 of those
