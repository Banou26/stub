 * be stored or its url can never be rendered. The relation decides how a node is LINKED, in
 * `upsertMedia`, not whether it is stored.
 *
 * THE WALK STOPS AT A PART_OF NODE, and that is the load bearing part. A PART_OF node is a CONTAINER,
 * usually a show, and its own handles are claims about the CONTAINER rather than about the run that
 * pointed at it. Carrying them through means two different runs, each hanging PART_OF off the same
 * show, each contribute a SAME_AS pair rooted at that show:
 *
 *     season 1 -PART_OF-> cr:SERIES -SAME_AS-> kitsu:42323
 *     season 3 -PART_OF-> cr:SERIES -SAME_AS-> kitsu:49002

 * and `cr:SERIES` is one uri, so the union-find puts kitsu:42323 and kitsu:49002 in one cluster. Two
 * seasons welded, with no inverse, by a relation whose entire purpose is not to weld. The container's
 * row still arrives, so its url renders; only its claims are dropped, because nothing can reach them
 * anyway: `findPartOfMedia` returns the direct targets of a cluster and never walks their handles.
 *
 * The copy is what enforces it. Returning the node untouched would leave `handles` populated for the
 * pair loop in worker/extractor.ts to read, so the subtree has to be cut here rather than there.
 *
 * KEPT DELIBERATELY, and weighed against letting a container contribute its handles after all. Nothing
 * in the tree mints a PART_OF node carrying any, so the choice was only ever about which way the
 * default fails, and unrelated media being read as SAME_AS is the failure with no inverse.
