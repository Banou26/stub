 * Ways a cluster can be visibly wrong ABOUT ITSELF, without anyone having to say what it should be.

 * The merge fixtures decide each case by hand: these uris together, those two never. That is the right
 * way to pin a known answer and the wrong way to find an unknown one, because it only ever looks where
 * somebody already looked. These rules need no expected answer, so they can be swept over every
 * cluster in the corpus at once, and over a franchise walked live.
 *
 * Every rule here is a CONTRADICTION rather than a preference. A cluster that trips one is claiming
 * two things that cannot both be true, which is why it is safe to run them everywhere.
