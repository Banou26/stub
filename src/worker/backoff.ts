// 522/524 are a gateway failing to reach the thing behind it, which is the shape almost every
// upstream outage takes: api.jikan.moe answers 504 "Jikan failed to connect to MyAnimeList" while
// api.jikan.moe/v4/anime/1 stays 200, so the host is up and only the MAL-fetching endpoints flap.
// Leaving 504 out was the whole reason one flaky season request emptied stub's homepage.
//
// 500 is deliberately absent: it is as often a deterministic upstream bug as a blip, and retrying
// one costs three requests to reach the same answer.
