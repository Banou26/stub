/**
 * The `Ask` log: one row per question the similar consumer put through `similarMedia`, with what
 * that question came to.
 *
 * Section 7.3 of the representation design, and the row 7.5 reads to answer "why is Netflix missing
 * here": a cluster with no `nf` row and no `Ask` row was never asked, one with an `Ask` row whose
 * outcome is `refused` was asked and turned down, and one whose outcome is `declined` never reached
 * the source at all. Those are three different facts about a page and nothing else in the graph
 * tells them apart.
 *
 * THE LOG IS A HISTORY, NOT A DEDUPE. The key hashes the sequence number in with the question, so
 * the same question asked again after new evidence, or retried after a decline, is a SECOND row.
 * `Answer`'s key deliberately does the opposite (a byte-identical re-fetch is one row there, 4.1),
 * because an answer is a fact about a work while an ask is an event in a session: two asks that
 * carry the same bytes are still two asks, and a log that folded them would report one question
 * where four were spent against the consumer's cap.
 *
 * `recordAsk` promises that a row is written for one ask and for nothing else, that it costs nothing
 * at all while the `?graph` flag is down (it returns undefined before touching the engine, so the
 * 22 MB engine is never fetched), and that it never rejects: a caller records what it did and is
 * never made to handle the recording. `exportAsks` is the read side, behind `?export=answers` (see
 * `src/answers-export.ts`).
