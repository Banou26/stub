/**
 * The graph's DDL, section 2 of the representation design, as literal Cypher.
 *
 * `GRAPH_SCHEMA` is the statement list in dependency order: every node table before the rel tables
 * that name it, because a rel table declares every `FROM/TO` pair it will ever carry at `CREATE`
 * time (`ALTER` is not among the exercised facts). `createGraphSchema` runs them against an open
 * engine and promises that afterwards every table in the list exists; it refuses nothing and is
 * idempotent, since each statement carries `IF NOT EXISTS`, so a second boot is a no-op rather than
 * an error. It does not seed a row, and the plugin tables of 2.2 are created empty and stay empty
 * until step 2 puts a plugin behind them.
 *
 * TYPES OUTSIDE THE MEASURED FACT LIST. `docs/design-inputs/00-engine-facts.md` lists the column
 * types exercised on 2026-09-11; `BOOLEAN` and `MAP(STRING, INT64)` are not among them, and both are
 * in the design's own DDL. Measured here on 2026-09-12, `@ladybugdb/wasm-core` 0.20.4 under node:
 * both load and both carry a value, so neither is substituted. The whole list is re-measured on
 * every suite run by `tests/unit/worker/graph/schema.test.ts`, which is why no substitution is
 * guessed at.
 *
 * TWO MEASURED SURPRISES, both 2026-09-12 on the same engine, and the ingest has to live with each:
 *
 * - **A JS OBJECT PARAM BINDS AS A `STRUCT`, NEVER AS A `MAP`**, so `SET m.fieldSeq = $fieldSeq`
 *   is a binder error ("has data type STRUCT(titles INT64) but expected MAP(STRING, INT64)"), and
 *   the write spelling is `SET m.fieldSeq = map($keys, $values)`, which works from a plain param and
 *   from an `UNWIND` variable alike. The column reads BACK as an object either way.
 * - **An empty `STRING[]` reads back as NULL**, not as an empty list. Anything reading `selection`
 *   off an `Answer` row has to treat NULL as "the resolver returned no field", which
 *   `exportAnswers` does.
