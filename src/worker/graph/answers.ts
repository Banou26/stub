 * The `Answer` log: every source answer kept byte for byte, one row per answer, deduped on content.

 * Section 4.1 of the representation design. `recordAnswers` is called from the one `useOnResolve` in
 * `src/worker/extractor.ts`, so every source and every plugin source goes through it. It promises
 * that a row is written for an ANSWER and for nothing else (see the position whitelist below), that
 * a byte-identical re-fetch writes no row and moves no `seq`, and that it costs nothing at all while
 * the `?graph` flag is down: it returns undefined before touching the engine, so the 22 MB engine is
 * never fetched. It refuses to fail a resolve: a batch the engine rejects is logged and dropped, and
 * the answer the user asked for still returns.
 *
 * `exportAnswers` is the read side, behind `?export=answers` (see `src/answers-export.ts`).

 * WHICH POSITIONS ARE ANSWERS, as a closed whitelist of paths, never a blacklist of `handles`.

 * `MediaHandle.node` and `MediaRelationEdge.node` are both `Media!` (`schema.gql:226-231`, `:170`),
 * so a hook keyed on the named type alone cannot tell a source's own answer from the row it merely
 * names. A blacklist of the `handles` segment does not close it either: `relations` is the same
 * shape, an episode's `handles` are a third, and the next nested `Media!` the schema grows would
 * arrive silently as an answer. So the rule runs the other way: a result is an answer only when its
 * path is one of these, and everything else is a nested node that reaches the graph through its
 * parent's decomposition (4.2 step 6, which is step 1b).
 *
 * The value is the GraphQL type the position must return. Position AND type, so `Media.origin`, a
 * String field that happens to be named like the `origin` root, can never be mistaken for one.
 *
 * `similarMedia` is a `Media` today (`schema.gql:551`). When decision 2 lands and it answers a
 * payload, its `media` and `containing` join this list, and so do their `episodes`.
 *
 * `containingMedia` IS AN ANSWER TOO, and was missing here until 2026-09-13 (4.4). It is the same
 * shape as `similarMedia`: a source's own description of a season, episodes included. What differs is
 * only what the CONSUMER claims off it, `PART_OF` rather than `SAME_AS`, which is decided in
 * `similar-consumer.ts` and is no business of this whitelist. While it was absent the season's 24
 * episodes reached the old store through the position-blind inserters and the graph not at all, and
 * the graph got them one round trip later only because `askAddressOf` re-asked the claim's unowned
 * target as an ordinary `media`; `?export=answers` could not carry one, so no corpus could replay it.
