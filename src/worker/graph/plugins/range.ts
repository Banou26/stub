/**
 * `plugin:range`, P4 of 5.4: which rows of a longer packaging are THIS run's episodes, proven one
 * episode at a time.
 *
 * WHAT IT REPLACES, AND WHAT IT KEEPS. `alignmentOffset` (`consensus.ts:113-155`) read a single
 * OFFSET off the dates two sources share and shifted a whole list by it. The evidence survives here
 * verbatim (distinct numbers per UTC day, a day of slack for the Tokyo boundary, a day naming two
 * reference numbers disqualified, `MIN_ALIGNED` or nothing) and the conclusion does not: what is
 * written is one `EPISODE_LINK` per episode, so an inserted special costs one episode its link
 * rather than shifting every later one (3.4). The title-vote offset that put 13 of 25 Blue Exorcist
 * rows on the wrong Netflix episode (2026-09-10) has no successor: there is no offset anywhere.
 *
 * IT MINTS NO `SAME_AS` BETWEEN MEDIA. The "every episode paired, therefore the same thing" upgrade
 * was deleted from 5.4 P4, along with the rule that carried it, which is why the sequence rule below
 * is a NEW rule 3 and not the restored one: a season that holds this run is a container whatever
 * share of it pairs, and 8.4 is the case that says so, five Netflix seasons each `PART_OF` one run
 * with no upgrade at any coverage. The `PART_OF` that reached a candidate stays exactly as it was in
 * every branch below, including the one that mints a range.
 *
 * RULE 3 IS ALLOWED WHERE RULE 2 IS REFUSED, `retranslates` INCLUDED, and 3.4a gives the argument:
 * rule 2 is refused for a retranslating origin because it mints on a COVERAGE SCORE, and a score can
 * be wrong while looking strong (Netflix, 4 exact of 25, the best wrong pair outscoring the true one,
 * 2026-09-10). Rule 3 reads titles to ANCHOR and never to place: an anchor is exact, unique,
 * non-generic equality, or, only where those cannot bracket at all, a scored similarity that clears
 * `SCORED_ANCHOR_FLOOR` by `SCORED_ANCHOR_MARGIN` over its own runner-up (2026-09-13). Every pair
 * beyond the anchors is placed by ORDER: no row is ever paired by comparing its own title to
 * anything, and the gate mints nothing unless order placed a row inside the run.
 *
 * BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT THAT DOES NOT SAY, because the first version of this header said the stronger
 * thing and an executed probe disproved it. A weld WRITES ITS OWN ANCHOR PAIR, exactly as an exact
 * match does, and where no exact anchor survives, the offset the bracket counts in came from scores
 * alone. So the distinction from the failure this file was written against is not "a score places
 * nothing": it is that the title-vote offset fitted ONE global offset out of title votes, a minority
 * of which could carry it, and placed every row by it, where here an offset no equality corroborates
 * needs `MIN_SCORED_ANCHORS` welds that agree on it, each weld has to clear the floor and the margin
 * and take a number nothing else reached, every bracket has to count the same number of rows on each
 * side, and `scheduleSkew` is asked about the answer.
 *
 * PAIRS ARE ONLY EVER ONTO AN EXISTING MEMBER EPISODE, inside `1..runLength`. That is what lets a
 * date pair skip the two-witness bar a count-based loan needed (`consensus.ts:171,234`): the loan was
 * placed BY NUMBER onto a row that might not exist, and a pair is placed by a shared day onto a row
 * the run's own sources already list. The bar still applies to the window, which is P5's.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROMISES. Same graph, same scope, same output: every scan is ordered, every candidate is
 * decided by a pure function of the two episode lists and the cluster's length, and the one place
 * two rows could be picked from (several reference rows carrying one number on one day) resolves on
 * the lowest uri rather than on arrival order.
 *
 * THE 2C HOOK. `delta` is not built, so `ctx.delta.full` is always true and every scan below reads
 * the whole graph rather than the run clusters in `delta.clusters`. The statements are the anchored
 * ones of 5.4 P4 with the `UNWIND $clusters` head removed, which is also what keeps an empty graph
 * from meeting the empty-`UNWIND` runtime death (2026-09-12).
 *
 * THREE SPELLING CHOICES the spec's own Cypher does not fix, each made for a stated reason:
 * - The class 1 scan is UNDIRECTED, because a `PART_OF` points from the shorter side to the longer
 *   and 8.4's five seasons therefore point INTO the run. The reason is beside the statement.
 * - The scans return FLAT ROWS and are grouped in JS, where 5.4 P4 collects a struct per candidate. A
 *   struct field is typed from the first row of a list and a JSON column inside one is unmeasured on
 *   0.20.4, and the failure mode of getting that wrong is a whole statement dying at runtime after
 *   the binder passed it (`00-engine-facts.md`, step 1b).
 * - The candidate scan's uncertain set carries `asserted` from a FOLDING origin beside the six
 *   reasons 5.4 P4 lists. A Crunchyroll season reached by a source claim rather than by an `ask`
 *   lands as `asserted` (`plugin:direct`'s table), and 8.1 is exactly that row until a source ships
 *   `containing` (4.4).
 *
 * THE FOURTH INPUT, `EPISODE_CLAIMS`, is the one rule here that weighs no evidence of its own: a
 * source said two episodes are the same, and all this plugin decides is whether the two rows are
 * anywhere near each other in the graph. Inside one RUN cluster, or across an active attachment, it
 * is an `asserted` pair; anywhere else it is written REFUSED `foreign-episode`, which is
 * `db.ts:410`'s union with the guards it never had ("accepts a uri that was never set"). It is the
 * only reader that table has. The refusal is a row rather than a silence because the claim edge is
 * already there to hang it off, which is the same test the lend and member classes fail below: a
 * plugin may not invent an edge to carry its own silence.

/**
 * Rule 1's guard: a constant offset the candidate's OWN numbering cannot absorb is a SCHEDULE SKEW.
 *
 * Crunchyroll publishes the streaming schedule and ani.zip the broadcast one, and the two can run a
 * few days apart. When they do, Crunchyroll's episode N+1 lands inside the day of slack around
 * ani.zip's episode N while Crunchyroll's own N lands nowhere near it, so rule 1 pairs the whole list
 * one late and `plugin:aggregate` then fills slot 1 from episode 2: the user opens episode 1 and
 * watches episode 2. Measured on `anilist:208044` in the summer 2026 corpus, eleven pairs
 * `fromNumber N+1 toNumber N`, both lists numbered 1 to 12 with identical titles at the same number.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT A SKEW RATHER THAN A RENUMBERING, which is the whole of this function:
 *
 * - every in-window pair shares ONE offset. A per-episode disagreement is real date evidence, and a
 *   specials-shifted list (8.3) is piecewise rather than constant, so neither is touched here.
 * - the candidate numbers from 1 and fits inside the run (`min === 1`, `max <= runLength`), so it is
 *   numbering THIS run from the top rather than a segment of a longer whole. The Elusive Samurai
 *   (8.2) is the case this clause keeps out: rows 13 to 20 against a run of 12 start nowhere near 1,
 *   and their offset of -12 is a genuine renumbering onto 1 to 8.
 * - the offset would carry one of the candidate's own rows OFF the run, so it cannot be read as that
 *   candidate's numbering of this run at all. 8.4 is the case this clause keeps out, and it is the
 *   reason the clause exists: Fullmetal's Crunchyroll season 2 numbers its rows 1 to 13 inside a run
 *   of 64 and its pairs carry a constant +13, which every clause above admits and which IS a
 *   renumbering, because 14 to 26 are rows of that run and nothing is pushed off either end.
 *
 * An offset of ZERO needs no clause of its own: a candidate that reaches the last two is numbered
 * inside the run, so it absorbs zero by construction and the dates are agreeing with the numbering.
 *
 * Returns the offset when the pairing is a skew, so a refusal can print what it saw, and `null` when
 * rule 1 stands.

 * harness rather than through this function, which is the only way these numbers mean anything now
 * that `alignByTitle` welds (the first version of this comment quoted a run that had read its own
 * output as ground truth, and four of its headline figures moved when that was fixed).
 *
 * THE CURVE EITHER SIDE, from the live sweep. Below, the cliff is on the NEGATIVES and not on the
 * truth set: floor 0.55 or lower with margin 0.05 or lower lets up to 3 wrong pairings speak and
 * mints up to 28 wrong pairs (Sword Art Online season 3 welded onto the season 1 run, 2 anchors and
 * 2 rows placed, at 0.50/0.05), while floor 0.60 or more is 0 wrong at every margin tried. Above, the
 * cliff is recall: novel anchor recall 60.6% at 0.60, 56.7% at 0.70, 50.6% at 0.80, 27.7% at 0.90,
 * 2.2% at 0.95. Truth-set precision is 100% from floor 0.40 up at every margin, so precision alone
 * would have picked a much lower floor and the negatives are what forbid it.
 *
 * AND IT IS NOW MEASURED ON THIS SCORER, which it was not when the constant was chosen. The grid
 * above ran on frizbee `titleSimilarity` and 0.60 was carried across by a hazard-curve coincidence,
 * which was an inference. The same 98 cells were then swept on token Dice over the same truth set
 * and the same 68 negatives: Dice is the SAFER of the two by a wide margin, with 0 wrong anchors and
 * 0 negatives speaking at every cell whose margin is 0.05 or more, the only damage anywhere being
 * margin 0 at floors 0.35 and 0.40 (one wrong pairing, 6 wrong pairs: Food Wars season 3 welded onto
 * the Second Plate run). At the shipped cell: 1000 anchors proposed, 0 wrong, novel anchor recall
 * 57.1% of the 231 truth pairs no exact anchor reaches, 0 of 68 negatives speaking. So 0.60/0.15
 * sits well inside Dice's clean region rather than on its edge, and the margin below is the guard
 * that carries the low-floor cells rather than the floor.
 *
 * The hazard table that licensed the transfer is still worth keeping, because it is the only thing

 *
 * WHY A SECOND GUARD AT ALL, when floor 0.60 already shows 0 wrong on both axes: a wrong weld is
 * permanent, since union-find has no unlink, and the two guards fail independently. On the live
 * sweep margin 0.15 or more is 0 wrong pairings at EVERY floor, including the ones the floor alone

 * neighbour (`The Knight's Festival of the Hunt (Part 1)` against `(Part 2)`, Dice 0.857, gap

 * order works in comes from the anchors. Where every anchor is a weld, that offset came from scores
 * alone, and two votes for one offset is not a measurement: with zero exact anchors, two welds at
 * one offset and an equal gap between them, the rule minted four `EPISODE_LINK` rows off two
 * similarities (executed 2026-09-13, `The Black Swordsman Returns` onto `The Black Swordsman` at
 * 0.857 and `The Red Nosed Reindeer Again` onto `The Red Nosed Reindeer` at 0.889, on a season that
 * belongs to another run). That is the shape this file was written against, refitted from two votes
 * instead of one global one.
 *
 * WHY THREE, AND WHY IT IS FREE HERE. Three is rule 2's own bar for a title claim
 * (`MIN_EPISODE_TITLE_MATCHES`, `similar.ts:59`) and the bar the calibration's conservative closure
 * demanded before it would trust an offset at all. It costs nothing measurable: on the live corpus
 * (63 shows, 189 Netflix seasons, 790 pairings, 2026-09-13) the fallback unlocks five pairings the
 * exact rule cannot bracket, and all five stand under this bar, four of them on welds alone with 20,
 * 9, 8 and 6 anchors agreeing on one offset.
 *
 * ONE EXACT ANCHOR IS ENOUGH TO DROP BACK TO `MIN_ALIGNED`, which is why this reads
 * `anchors.length > scored` rather than a flat three. An equality corroborates the offset the welds

/**
 * Rule 3's first step: the ANCHORS, and the two ordered lists they sit in.
 *
 * An anchor is exact `stripTitle` equality, non-generic, and unique on each side, then MONOTONE: the
 * anchors are the longest increasing subsequence of those matches, so an alignment never crosses
 * itself. Three ways a match is dropped, each of them an identity question order cannot answer:
 *
 * - a key their side carries twice, exactly as rule 2 drops it;
 * - a key naming two different numbers of OURS (a key several rows of one number carry is that
 *   number's, however many origins spell it);
 * - a canonical number two of their rows reach, which is one row too many for one episode.
 *
 * THEN, AND ONLY WHERE THOSE CANNOT BRACKET AT ALL, the scored anchors of `scoredAnchors` are added
 * (2026-09-13). It is a FALLBACK and not a replacement, and the live sweep is why: as a replacement
 * at these constants the anchor recall rises from 66.0% to 86.5% and rule 3's OWN contribution falls
 * by two thirds, 250 rows placed by order becoming 87, 46 of 65 pairings speaking becoming 17, 810
 * pairs minted becoming 367. Every extra anchor consumes a row a bracket would otherwise have
 * forced, and it is bought with no precision at all, since the exact rule is already at 0 wrong. As a
 * fallback the same sweep keeps all 43 truth pairings the exact rule speaks on, adds 0 certainly
 * wrong, and unlocks 5 pairings the exact rule cannot bracket at all.
 *
 * WHAT IT BUYS, measured on THIS CODE rather than on an emulation of it (2026-09-13, the whole 790
 * pairing cross product, `alignByTitle` against an exact-only alignment over the same two lists,
 * both through the gate). On the 65 truth pairings and the 68 hard negatives the two are IDENTICAL:
 * 43 speaking, 162 rows placed, 769 pairs, 0 wrong, and 0 of the negatives speaking either way. The
 * whole of the difference is 5 pairings the exact rule cannot bracket at all, and 78 pairs on them:
 * Attack on Titan season 1 onto anilist 16498 (20 welds agreeing on offset 0, 25 pairs), Naruto
 * season 6 and season 8 onto anilist 20 (offset 135 and 186, 21 and 18 pairs), Mob Psycho 100 season
 * 3 onto 140439 (11), Blue Exorcist season 3 onto 158931 (3). None is a hard negative, and all five
 * are corroborated by the one judge that reads no title at all: the offset each one produces closes
 * the count surplus exactly and covers every surplus row with a dated special. Two of the five
 * carry NO exact anchor, which is the population neither sweep could certify, so the count closure
 * is the strongest thing said about them.
 *
 * So below `MIN_ALIGNED` exact anchors, which is exactly where the shipped rule mints NOTHING, the
 * score is consulted; at or above it this function returns what it always returned, byte for byte.
 * That is what makes the change purely additive: no pair the exact rule minted can be lost.
 *
 * Every list is sorted before it is read (their rows by number then uri, ours by number, the
 * specials by uri), so the alignment is a function of the two lists and not of the scan's order.

 * pair target never, since there is no slot for it inside `1..runLength` (5.4 P5).

 * | `dates` | rule 1 left at least `MIN_ALIGNED` pairs inside the window and they are not a skew |
 * | `titles` | rule 1 did not, the candidate's origin does not retranslate, and rule 2 cleared both halves of its bar |
 * | `sequence` | neither did, and rule 3's alignment placed a row by ORDER: `minAnchorsFor` anchors, at least one row forced by a bracket or by 3.4a's closure AND still inside the window, `MIN_ALIGNED` pairs inside the window, and not the same offset rule 1 refused as a skew |
 * | `retranslates` | nothing was proven and rule 2 was refused outright (Netflix, 4 exact of 25, the best wrong pair above the true one, 2026-09-10) |
 * | `date-skew` | rule 1's pairs were a constant offset the candidate's own numbering cannot absorb (`scheduleSkew`) and neither rule 2 nor rule 3 minted |
 * | `ambiguous-day` | rule 1 reached reference days and a day named two reference numbers |
 * | `unequal-gap` | rule 3 anchored and a bracket counted a different number of rows on each side, so order placed nothing |
 * | `no-anchors` | both sides carry non-generic titles and rule 3 found fewer anchors than `minAnchorsFor` asks of it, which is two, or three where no exact equality holds the alignment down (Netflix's season 1, 3.4a point 4) |
 * | `no-titles` | both sides carry non-generic titles, rule 2 missed its bar, and rule 3 anchored with nothing to force, or nothing it forced landed inside the window |
 * | `no-dates` | everything else: the date rule could not run or its days met nothing, and the title rules had no material either |
 *
 * RULE 3 RUNS THIRD, and where rule 2 is REFUSED rather than merely short of its bar. Two things fix
 * that position. It is the weakest evidence of the three, since a bracket consults no evidence at all
 * for the row it forces, and the rules are ordered by what they measure. And it is the only one that
 * may read a retranslating origin's titles, because it reads them to ANCHOR and never to place (see
 * the header), so putting it before rule 2 would let an alignment answer where a coverage that
 * cleared both halves of its bar was available. A scored anchor does not move it: rule 2 mints ON a
 * score, where rule 3 mints only what order places, and that is the whole difference between them.
 *
 * A PAIRING RULE 1 REFUSED AS A SKEW IS NOT RESURRECTED BY RULE 3. `scheduleSkew` is asked again
 * about rule 3's own pairs: an alignment that reproduces the offset the dates were refused for is
 * refused for the same reason, and one that disagrees with it (the usual case, since the anchors are
 * exact titles) stands. A candidate longer than the run reaches that guard's last clause and is never
 * a skew, which is why the Netflix season of 25 against a run of 24 is admitted.
 *
 * THE WINDOW IS APPLIED BEFORE THE BAR. A pair whose `toNumber` falls outside `1..runLength` is
 * dropped rather than counted (`consensus.ts:185-191`): a season containing this run brings episodes
 * on both sides of it, the previous cour lands at zero and below and the next above the length, and
 * counting those toward `MIN_ALIGNED` would let a neighbouring cour carry a fold over the bar.
