/**
 * Six of the anomaly rules of 5.5, as rules and nothing else.
 *
 * A rule here needs NO EXPECTED ANSWER: it reads the graph after a pass and says what disagrees with
 * itself. `disagreeing-ids` and `contested` read what the guards of 5.2 already decided, so the two
 * cannot drift apart; `kind-disagrees` and `constant-id` read the source tables directly, because
 * both are properties of what the sources said rather than of what a rule concluded. `over-length` and
 * `count-disagrees` are the two that read a COUNT: the first weighs what a page would draw against
 * what the sources voted, the second is one source disagreeing with its own list.
 *
 * THE REPORTING SURFACE. 5.5 writes these to `Cluster.anomalies` with `anomalyCount` and the trace
 * panel prints them (7.5); `plugin:aggregate` reads every rule here once per pass and files each
 * finding under the clusters holding the uris it names. Every rule ships with a control fixture that
 * must report zero, so a rule that cannot fire in its failure state is caught by its own test (5.5's
 * own words).
