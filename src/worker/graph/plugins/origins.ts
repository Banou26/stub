 * recording made before that carries no stamp, and so does any remote plugin source that never
 * learns to send one. A claimer whose own data cannot carry the target's id space is echoing the
 * address back: Netflix publishes no AniList id anywhere, so `nf` naming `anilist:X` came from the
 * uri it was asked about and nowhere else. That is the fallback, and this table is its premise.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS NATIVE: a handle built from a field of the source's own response, or from a url that
 * response carried. A handle from `buildHandlesFromUri` or added by `mergeHandles` never counts, which
 * is the whole distinction being drawn.
 *
 * AN ORIGIN ABSENT FROM THIS TABLE IS TRUSTED, and that is the safe direction: the fallback can only
 * narrow origins whose extractor was read line by line, so a remote plugin source, a new first-party
 * source, or anything else unread keeps `source` and is decided by the guards as before. Adding a
 * wrong entry costs a real claim, so an origin goes in only with the line that builds the handle.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ABSENT, each for its own reason rather than by omission:
 * - `offline`: the seed's identity handles are an export of a real cluster and can name ANY origin
 *   (`sources/offline/seed.ts:108`), so it has no bounded id space to test against. Its SAME_AS is
 *   `seed` before the fallback is reached anyway, and `offline/extractor.ts:163-166` is the narrower
 *   of its two paths, not the whole of it.
 * - `imdb`, `anidb`, `amazon`, `disney`, `hbo`, `hulu`, `peacock`, `fubo`, `paramount`: read, and each
 *   builds no handle at all, so no claim of theirs ever reaches the lookup.
 *
 * Every entry was read off the extractor on 2026-09-12; the citation is the line that mints the handle.
