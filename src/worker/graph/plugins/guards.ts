/**
 * The nine guards of 5.2, the downgrade they write instead, and the `partOf` guards beside them.
 *
 * EVERY `SAME_AS` PROPOSAL PASSES THESE, whatever plugin made it, and the writer is the one caller
 * (`./writer.ts`). A guard never edits a proposal: it returns a verdict, and a refusal carries both
 * the row that records it (`LINK {status: 'refused', reason}`) and, for six of the nine, the
 * containment edge the writer writes instead. A wrong CONTAINER is a missing `SAME_AS`, recoverable
 * by a later proof; a wrong `SAME_AS` is a lie about what the user is about to watch
 * (`db.ts:142-145`), so a refusal costs a button and never a badge.
 *
 * WHAT IS READ, AND WHEN. A batch is PREPARED once (`prepareGuards`) with every pair the writer is
 * about to weigh: five reads, then every verdict is computed in JS off that snapshot. Two of the
 * guards say what they read in their own rule:
 * - guard 4 is evaluated against the GRAPH AS IT STANDS, never within one pass, so the snapshot is
 *   taken before the first verdict and no proposal of this pass can move it,
 * - guard 5 is evaluated over every CLAIM rather than over active links, so two claimants landing in
 *   different flushes meet anyway and the verdict is the same on every later pass.
 *
 * THE SNAPSHOT IS TAKEN BEFORE THE DIFF, so it holds rows this same apply is about to delete. That is
 * the rule's own wording ("the graph as it stands") and it is deliberate, but it surprises a reader
 * twice: a pair the previous apply joined with a `PART_OF` is `contained` in the apply that retracts
 * that `PART_OF`, and a weld the previous apply wrote can move the verdict on a neighbouring pair
 * from guard 7 to guard 4. Neither is a cycle, because the next iteration reads the moved graph and
 * agrees with itself; the pass's own fixed-point loop is what absorbs them (2 iterations on a
 * recorded page, 2026-09-12).
 *
 * THE COMPONENT READ IS AN EDGE LIST, NOT A WALK PER URI. `MATCH (a)-[e:LINK*0..8 (r, _ | WHERE
 * r.kind = 'SAME_AS' AND r.status = 'active')]-(b)` is the spelling of 3.5 and it is what the test
 * asserts this agrees with, uri by uri; issuing it once per endpoint would be one recursive walk per
 * proposal (6.8 ms each on a session sized graph, 2026-09-11). One read of the active `SAME_AS`
 * edges plus a union-find in JS is the same relation for the whole batch.
 *
 * THE REMAINING 2C HOOK: the component read is whole-graph and becomes a delta-scoped read when
 * `delta` arrives. Guard 7 now reads `Cluster.runLength`, the witnessed figure of 5.4 P5, wherever a
 * cluster holds the run side, and falls back to that row's own profile count where none does yet,
 * which is every row on the first iteration of a pass.
