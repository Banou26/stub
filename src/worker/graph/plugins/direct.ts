/**
 * `plugin:direct`, P1 of 5.4: the claims a SOURCE made, turned into proposals and edges.
 *
 * It decides nothing about similarity. Every row it emits is one `CLAIMS` edge read through the
 * derivation table of `db.ts:166-169`, kept verbatim, plus the same-origin rule and the fenced
 * `INCLUDES`; the union-by-id pairs (mal, anilist, kitsu, anizip, offline, simkl agree by first-party
 * ids) need no matching at all. `supports` is the claim's own key, so a trace descends from the link
 * to the claim and from there to the `Answer` that carried it.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROMISES. Same graph, same output: the scan is ordered, the decision is a pure function of
 * the claim and the two profiles, and nothing here reads a clock, a score or another plugin's link.
 * Whether a `SAME_AS` proposal becomes an edge is not its call: the writer's guards decide, a refusal
 * is written with its reason, and six of the nine refusals write the containment edge instead (5.2).
 *
 * ITS FAILURE MODE, stated because it is the reason guards 4 and 5 exist. A per-run origin that is
 * show-level for a MINORITY of its ids welds two runs the moment both claim it: `mal:51535` sits on
 * both Attack on Titan Final Chapters parts, while `idMal` is per-run for about 99.7% of ids and
 * blocking `mal` outright would cost 3,184 correct merges (2026-09-01). The guards catch it when the
 * two parts' own anilist and kitsu ids meet, and both sides downgrade (8.6). Two wrong `SAME_AS`
 * between rows whose origins never disagree still weld, as today; the weld is an edge with a
 * `supports` list, deletable, and reported the moment a later id disagrees.

 * The candidate scan of 5.4 P1, verbatim, in its whole-graph form and its keyed form.
 *
 * A SCOPED run reads EVERY claim at every subject uri, in both directions, rather than the claims the
 * delta named. That is not thrift, it is the invariant: the scope this run declares is its subjects,
 * so the writer may retract any `LINK` with a subject at either end, and a run that read one claim at
 * a uri and re-derived one link would have the writer delete every other link that uri carries.
 * Reading by uri also covers the second consumer, `MediaProfile`: every decision below reads the
 * effective scope and the id parent off the two profiles, so a claim whose key never moved still has
 * to be re-decided when a profile at either end did.
 *
 * THE PROFILES ARE A SECOND STATEMENT, joined in JS, and only in the scoped form. Measured on the 800
 * recorded rows of one page, 2026-09-12: the claim read and the two `PROFILE_OF` joins in ONE
 * `UNWIND` statement cost 545 ms for 28 subjects, about 19 ms per subject, against 326 ms for the
 * whole-graph form over every claim in the graph. Split, the same 28 subjects cost single-digit ms.
 * It is the same reason `plugin:profile`'s own scan is one statement per relation: an `UNWIND` whose
 * MATCH carries three patterns multiplies before it aggregates.
 *
 * The two directions are merged on the claim key, which is unique (2.1), and the merged rows are
 * sorted back into the order each read was asked in.
