/**
 * The field policy of 6.3 and 6.4: which member supplies each field of an aggregated row, what the
 * card carries, and what is recorded about every choice.
 *
 * POLICY, THEREFORE A PLUGIN'S (6.3). `aggregateFields` and `aggregateEpisodeFields` are pure
 * functions of the rows handed to them, versioned with `plugin:aggregate`, executed at WRITE time
 * into `Cluster.card`, `Cluster.media`, `Cluster.episodes` and `Slot.episode`. No read chooses a
 * field value; a read is a lookup of what these wrote.
 *
 * WHAT THEY PROMISE. Same rows, same output, whatever order the rows arrived in. The members are
 * sorted once, by score descending and then by uri, and every rule below reads that one order:
 * `aggregate.ts:379-381` records today's reduce as "non-deterministic between loads" because a tie
 * inside one score tier fell to arrival order, and that is the one behaviour change 6.3 asks for.
 *
 * TWO DIFFERENCES FROM `src/worker/store/aggregate.ts`, both named in 6.3:
 * - ties inside a score tier are broken by uri, never by arrival order,
 * - the SINGLETON PATH IS GONE (`aggregate.ts:308-317` returned the member's own uri, origin and url
 *   with no normalization). One rule for every cluster size, so a cluster of one is a cluster.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE GENERATED `Media`. 6.3 adds four fields the schema does not carry yet (`kind`,
 * `scope`, `provenance`, `anomalies`) and an `INCLUDES` value of `MediaHandleRelation`, so the
 * materialized row is deliberately typed here rather than as `src/generated/schema`'s `Media`. The
 * field NAMES are the schema's, so the read path of step 3 selects them unchanged.
