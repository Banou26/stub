/**
 * `plugin:title`, P3 of 5.4: two clusters that agree on a title, and what that agreement is allowed
 * to do.
 *
 * IT IS THE FUZZY PASS MOVED, NOT REWRITTEN. Every threshold, the tier selection, the trailing-number
 * rule, the companion rule and the similarity call come from `src/worker/store/fuzzy-merge.ts` and
 * `src/sources/utils.ts` BY IMPORT, so while both passes exist they cannot disagree about what 0.9
 * means. What is NEW is the record: the old pass returned a boolean and left nothing behind, and this
 * one writes the verdict, the four gate outcomes and the evidence onto the `LINK` row (2.2, 5.2), so
 * "why are these one card" and "why are these two" are both queries.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROPOSES, AND WHAT IT NEVER DECIDES. It proposes `SAME_AS` and nothing else. A verdict
 * between a run cluster and a container cluster is proposed exactly the same way, and the WRITER
 * downgrades it to `PART_OF` reason `cross-scope` (5.2): "a title match between a run and a show is a
 * guess at containment, so it rides an edge, never a union: the edge can be deleted, a union cannot"
 * (`fuzzy-merge.ts:660-666`). Whether a proposal becomes an edge is never this file's call, which is
 * what lets the guards add what the fuzzy pass never had (disagreeing ids, the count veto, the
 * contained check).
 *
 * WHAT IT PROMISES. Same graph, same scope, same output: every scan is ordered, every set the gates
 * read is a function of the cluster's members rather than of their arrival order, the six titles are
 * selected by the measured rule (`fuzzy-merge.ts:215-219`), and the pair is ordered before it is
 * compared so the evidence names the same two titles whichever side the scan reached first.
 *
 * THE STICKY HALF, and the reason it is not optional here. An active `SAME_AS` this plugin wrote has
 * already been spent: `plugin:aggregate` closed over it, so its two clusters ARE one cluster by the
 * next iteration and the pair it was derived from no longer exists to be re-derived. The writer's
 * desired set is the whole of what this plugin owns, so a link it does not re-propose is DELETED,
 * the clusters split, the pair reappears, and the pass oscillates until the cap. So every active
 * `SAME_AS` this plugin owns is re-proposed from the row it already wrote, with its own evidence and
 * gates, and the guards weigh it again: "an active SAME_AS is re-checked against guards 2 and 4 to 9
 * and retracted only when a guard now fails... Profile drift never retracts: a title link whose pair
 * no longer clears 0.9 after a member's titles changed stays active" (5.2, the sticky rule).
 *
 * THE 2C HOOK. `delta` is not built yet, so both scans run over EVERY cluster rather than over the
 * dirty set and its bucket mates. The statements are the anchored ones of 5.4 P3 with `$clusters`
 * being every id, which is the form the spec states for the full pass: a key lookup per cluster
 * rather than a list scan per row.
 *
 * THE SECOND CANDIDATE AXIS, and the only thing here that does not go through a year bucket. A
 * catalogue's show row carries the SHOW's title and the SHOW's date, and a show's date is its FIRST
 * run's, so every later run of every multi-run show sat in a different bucket from its own show and
 * attached to no streaming container at all. `containerKeyOf` reads the show title out of a run title
 * that carries a season marker of 2 or more, and gate 3 goes silent for exactly that pair, because a
 * show's debut and a second season's premiere are two different runs' dates and the 45 days were
 * never a figure about those. Both are narrow on purpose and both are measured
 * (`scripts/calibrate-container-ordinal.test.ts`).
 *
 * THE KNOWN GAP SURVIVES, deliberately. Both silent-side vetoes only ever block on a DISAGREEMENT, so
 * `86` and `86 Part 2`, one naming a season and one not, both dated by a year alone, still weld on
 * their shared label. Closing it costs one wrong weld stopped per 37 correct merges destroyed
 * (`fuzzy-merge.ts:405-427`), and the broadcast-quarter veto that would reach 583 of 1,095 such pairs
 * is unmeasured for cost. It is pinned as a gap in `tests/unit/worker/graph/plugins/title.test.ts`.

 * The ORDINAL AXIS: the container title a run key names, or nothing when the key names no later run.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. A catalogue's show row carries the SHOW's title and the SHOW's date, and the show's
 * date is its FIRST run's. So `jw:222366` is "Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation", dated
 * 2021-01-11, and every later run of that show sits in a different year bucket from it and 903 days
 * away from it. The year bucket of gate 0 never pairs them and gate 3 would refuse them if it did, so
 * the second, third and fourth run of EVERY multi-run show attached to no JustWatch, no Netflix and
 * no Disney row at all. This is the second axis the same cause needed, `pickContainingSeason`'s
 * ordinal reading being the first (5.4 P5).
 *
 * THREE CONDITIONS, each priced separately over the manami database (41537 records, 2026-27,
 * `scripts/calibrate-container-ordinal.test.ts`):
 * - the key reads an ordinal of 2 or more, so a first run never takes this route and keeps the year
 *   bucket as its only one. Dropping the floor to 1 raises the cross-franchise count 360 to 370 while
 *   buying nothing the bucket does not already pair.
 * - removing the season markers has to CHANGE the key. This one buys NOTHING measurable there, and
 *   the harness says so: allowing it adds 16 pairs and 0 cross-franchise pairs. It is kept because
 *   the pairs it admits are a key naming ITSELF, which is a run and a container agreeing on a title
 *   ACROSS two year buckets, and manami holds no container rows for that shape to be priced against.
 *   The keys that reach it are a bare `N期` or `N기`, which `parseSeasonNumber` reads and
 *   `SEASON_MARKER` deliberately declines to delete.
 * - what is left is not empty, since a title that is nothing but a season label names a POSITION and
 *   never a show (`isOnlySeasonLabel`, and it is what welded Grand Blue into Mushoku Tensei once).
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS, under one identical non-lexical label (manami's `related` graph, unioned over shared
 * source urls, which has no title in it anywhere): 5,946 pairs of which 360 cross a franchise, 6.05%.
 * The exact-key route this store already ships scores 71.58% on the same corpus under the same label
 * and the same route with the year bucket removed scores 97.54%, so the axis is an order of magnitude
 * cleaner than the mechanism it sits beside rather than a widening of it. The corpus model is wider
 * than production in both directions that matter (every synonym is a key where a cluster ships six,
 * and every record is an available container where a real container is one show-level row out of a
 * handful of catalogues), so 6.05% is an upper bound.
