/**
 * `plugin:profile`, P0 of 5.4: one `MediaProfile` per `Media` row and one `EpisodeProfile` per
 * `Episode` row, plus the `TitleKey` nodes and `HAS_KEY` edges that make exact title agreement a join
 * rather than a pairwise loop.
 *
 * EVERY RULE HERE IS A DERIVATION FROM THE RECORD, and none of them is a merge decision: nothing in
 * this file compares two rows, proposes a link or reads another plugin's output. That is what lets
 * every later plugin read one row instead of re-deriving the same reading of `raw` five times, and it
 * is why this plugin is `after: []` and first in the pass.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROMISES. Same graph, same scope, same output: every derivation is a pure function of the
 * row, its `Answer` log, the claims stamped on it and the episodes its own origin hung on it. No
 * clock, no random, no ordering dependence (a title tie is broken by the key itself, ascending).
 *
 * THREE READINGS ARE NOT THE ROW'S OWN and are read off the tables in `./origins.ts`: whether the
 * origin folds cours into seasons, whether it commissions its own episode titles, and whether every
 * one of its ids names a container. A source that declares the field wins over the table (4.6); none
 * of them declares one today, which is stated there rather than repeated here.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY SILENT. A rule with nothing to say writes NULL and never a zero: `NULL = the
 * titles name no season` is a different fact from `season 0`, and 284 of 4,159 real titles end in a
 * bare number that names no season at all (2026-08-11). Every column below that can be silent says so
 * where it is derived.
