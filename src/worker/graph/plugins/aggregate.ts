/**
 * `plugin:aggregate`, P5 of 5.4: the materialized view. Membership, the cluster ids, the run length,
 * the slots and every JSON a read looks up.
 *
 * IT IS THE ONLY PLACE A CLUSTER EXISTS. Sameness closes over active `SAME_AS` links and nothing else
 * (3.5), the closure is computed here once per pass by a union-find over the edge list, and what it
 * comes to is written as `MEMBER_OF` so no read ever recurses (6.8 ms per uri against 1.7 ms for a
 * materialized lookup, 2026-09-11). Every row with an effective scope sits in exactly one cluster,
 * singletons and placeholders included, which is what makes the listing read uniform and the
 * singleton branch of `aggregate.ts:308-317` unnecessary.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROMISES.
 * - Same graph, same output: every list read is ordered, every group is keyed on a uri, and the ids
 *   are carried from the previous output rather than minted per pass. A second pass over an unmoved
 *   graph writes nothing, which is the contract the writer enforces and this file has to keep.
 * - An id is minted ONCE per component and carried across growth (`carryComponentId`'s rule,
 *   `graph.ts:246-263`, executed in a pass instead of during a read): on a merge the larger keeps its
 *   id, ties to the lexicographically smaller `key`, and the loser becomes an `Alias` row; on a split
 *   the id stays with the fragment holding the previous `key`.
 * - `Cluster.published` only ever GROWS, so `ag:(...)` never shrinks and an address the app already
 *   handed out keeps resolving.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO. It proposes no link and reads no title: membership is whatever the links
 * already say. A row it cannot scope has no cluster, which is the same silence `plugin:direct` keeps
 * for an unknown scope (5.2 guard 1).
 *
 * THE 2C HOOK, and where the 2D rules sit:
 * - `scope.full` every pass. 5.4 P5 splits the declaration in two (membership global, the slots and
 *   the JSON per dirty cluster); the dirty set is `delta`, which arrives with the scheduler.
 * - `Cluster.hidden`, `hiddenBy`, `kind` and `preferredRun` are columns of THIS plugin's row, because
 *   the writer diffs a table per plugin and a second writer would be a second row for one primary key
 *   (5.2). The RULES are `plugin:containment`'s and are imported from it (6.1, 6.5, 5.4 P2), computed
 *   over the same active containment edges that plugin turns into `ATTACHED_TO`, so the two cannot
 *   disagree about an attachment and the verdict needs no round trip and no second iteration.
 * - `via: 'aligned'` fills are the pairs `plugin:range` proved (5.4 P4), and they are the ONLY way a
 *   row that is not a member's own reaches a slot: at the pair's `toNumber`, inside `1..runLength`,
 *   onto a slot a member already fills. A member row a pair renumbered is `aligned` too, because
 *   `via` says where the NUMBER came from (3.2), which for those rows is the pair and not the row.

 * it. So three bars stand between a row and being hidden, and all three are the record's:
 *
 * - TWO WITNESSES (`consensus.ts:171`). A length resting on one row, acted on, hides episodes that
 *   aired: MAL publishes no count for Mushoku Tensei season 2 part 1 and AniList says 13 for a run
 *   that aired 12 (2026-09-09).
 * - A STRICTLY LOWER TIER (`consensus.ts:210-211`). A source that agrees about the length
 *   (`reference`) and a source at or above the deciding tier (`equals`) are never trimmed: two 0.9
 *   catalogues disagreeing is a disagreement, and the answer to one is to show the tier's majority,
 *   never to delete the dissenter's episodes.
 * - TWICE THE WEIGHT. The backing's summed score must be at least twice the trimmed claim's, which is

 * - A SLOT A MEMBER ALREADY FILLS, at the pair's own `toNumber`. So a lent season can never ADD a
