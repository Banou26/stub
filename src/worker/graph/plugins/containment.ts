/**
 * `plugin:containment`, P2 of 5.4: the RUN versus CONTAINER exchange, as edges between CLUSTERS.
 *
 * It attaches and it never mints sameness. That is the whole fence: "a catalogue that folds two cours
 * into one season premieres on the SAME DAY as the first of them, so neither axis can see the fold"
 * (`similar.ts:143-146`), so a season that covers a run's start is drawn as a container and never
 * merged into it. A wrong attachment costs a badge; a wrong weld costs the user the wrong episode.
 *
 * WHAT IT PRODUCES.
 * - `ATTACHED_TO(run cluster, container cluster, via, supports)` for every active `PART_OF` out of a
 *   member, expanded to the TARGET'S OWN CLUSTER, which is the one hop of 3.5 materialized once per
 *   pass instead of walked per read.
 * - `LINK PART_OF` reason `span`: a folding origin's season whose own episode days cover a run's
 *   start and which is longer than the run. Exactly one season may qualify per run; two is a refusal,
 *   written as a refused row so it can be queried, and zero is silence.
 * - `LINK PART_OF` reason `inside`: the repair of the invariant of 3.5, below.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT WRITE, AND WHY. `Cluster.preferredRun`, `Cluster.hidden`, `Cluster.hiddenBy` and
 * `Cluster.kind` are columns of a row `plugin:aggregate` owns, and the writer diffs a table per plugin
 * (`WHERE by = $id`, 5.2), so a second plugin writing `Cluster` would be a second row for one primary
 * key rather than a column. The RULES are here, exported as pure functions, and `plugin:aggregate`
 * calls them over the same active `PART_OF` list this plugin turns into `ATTACHED_TO`, so the verdict
 * costs no round trip, needs no second iteration and cannot drift from the edges the read walks.
 *
 * A REQUESTED URI IS NEVER HIDDEN, and that is the read path's job rather than this one's (6.1, 6.2).
 * `Cluster.hidden` is the store-wide truth about whether a cluster belongs in a LISTING; the resolve
 * of 6.2 answers with the cluster holding the asked row whatever the flag says. Writing the flag per
 * request would make the column depend on who is looking.
 *
 * DELTAS ARE NOT BUILT YET (step 2c's hook, still open): `ctx.delta.full` is true on every call, so
 * every scan below runs over the WHOLE graph and the output declares `scope.full`. The delta forms
 * are the same queries with `UNWIND $clusters AS cid` in front, which is how 5.4 P2 states them.
