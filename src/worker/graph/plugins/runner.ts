/**
 * The pass: one walk of the plugins in `after` order, iterated to a fixed point, then audited
 * (section 5.3).
 *
 * `runPlugins` is the whole of the scheduler's inner loop. It does NOT subscribe to `graph:changed`
 * and it does not coalesce emits: `./scheduler.ts` owns the wake, and hands what that wake named to
 * the trigger here.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROMISES.
 * - A plugin is handed SUBJECTS, never a seq range. Iteration 1 of a `graph:changed` pass carries the
 *   wake's own uris, episode uris and claim keys; iteration 2 and later carry what the writer applied
 *   in the iteration before, mapped through each plugin's `consumes`. A `boot` or a `manual` trigger
 *   is a FULL pass, and so is a `graph:changed` trigger that named nothing.
 * - A plugin runs at most `PASS_CAP` times per call. Hitting the cap is an anomaly, never a warning,
 *   so a graph that keeps hitting it is visible rather than merely slow.
 * - A repeated state hash ends the loop and is reported. The hash is taken over the deltas the writer
 *   APPLIED, so two iterations that wrote the same rows are a cycle even when the plugins disagree
 *   about why.
 * - A plugin that throws keeps its previous output (the writer is never called for it), the pass
 *   continues with the plugins after it, and the failure is reported. An empty desired set would
 *   retract everything it ever wrote, which is the one thing a failure must not do.
 * - The source tables are unchanged by the pass, and that is CHECKED rather than asserted: every
 *   source row with `seq <= passStart` is re-hashed in JS before and after, and any difference is
 *   reported with the row that moved.
 *
 * WHY THE AUDIT IS THE PROOF AND THE OTHER TWO LAYERS ARE NOT. `PluginOutput` cannot name a source
 * table (layer 1, the type, plus the writer's runtime check), and `ctx.query` refuses the write verbs
 * (layer 2, below). Both are defences a plugin holding any other handle walks straight past, which is
 * exactly what the control in `tests/unit/worker/graph/plugins/runner.test.ts` does: it takes
 * `graphReady()` for itself and rewrites an `Answer.raw`. The audit is what catches it.
 *
 * THE BOUND, and why it is per table. 5.3 bounds the audit at `seq <= passStart` so a DataLoader
 * flush landing mid-pass (every call is an await) does not read as a mutation. `Answer.seq` is the
 * log's own sequence and `Media.seq` is the ingest's commit sequence, so there is no single number
 * that bounds both: the bound is `max(seq)` of each table, read at pass start, and the "after" read
 * uses the same numbers. A row the ingest wrote or re-asserted during the pass carries a higher seq
 * and is outside the window by construction, which is the second control.
