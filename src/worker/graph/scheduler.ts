/**
 * The scheduler of 5.3: the wake is the event, one pass at a time, one pending wake behind it.
 *
 * `runPlugins` is the inner loop and knows nothing about events; this file is the only thing that
 * subscribes to the ingest's `graph:changed` and `row:changed`, the only thing that decides when a
 * pass runs, and the only thing that emits `view:changed` (4.5, 6.6).
 *
 * WHAT IT PROMISES.
 * - AT MOST ONE PASS IN FLIGHT, and at most one wake waiting behind it. Two overlapping `runPlugins`
 *   calls would interleave on the runner's module state (`lastCompleted`, `previousOutput`), so the
 *   gate is the whole point rather than an optimization. A wake landing mid-pass merges into the
 *   pending wake: never a queue, so a burst of twenty commits costs one more pass and not twenty.
 * - The pending wake carries the UNION of the uris every merged wake named and the HIGHEST `seq`,
 *   which is what a scoped pass will read once scoping lands (step 2, `delta.full` is still true).
 * - `view:changed` fires AFTER a pass that applied something, naming the clusters it touched and
 *   every member uri of those clusters. A pass that applied nothing emits nothing, which is the
 *   second half of the idempotence contract of 6.6 (the first is the ingest's, which emits no
 *   `graph:changed` for a batch that moved nothing, so an idempotent replay wakes no pass at all).
 * - A pass that throws is caught, logged once, and releases the gate: the wake behind it still runs.
 *   Nothing here ever throws into the event bus.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO YET. `row:changed` is a plain wake, the same as `graph:changed`: the cheaper
 * re-materialization of 4.5 (the touched clusters' JSON only, no guards and no links) is a later
 * step, and until it exists a raw-only change is served by a full pass rather than not at all.
 * Scoping is the same story: the trigger carries the uris, and `runPlugins` still runs every plugin
 * with `delta.full`.
