/**
 * THE TRACE of section 7.5: "why is this here", as ONE bundle for ONE cluster.
 *
 * Section 7.5 lists nine questions a bug report asks and gives the Cypher for each. This module runs
 * all of them for one address and answers a single JSON document, because the panel that renders it
 * cannot ask nine follow-up questions over osra while a user is looking at a wrong page.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROMISES.
 * - **A REFUSED ROW IS FIRST CLASS.** Every `LINK` and `EPISODE_LINK` the bundle names is carried
 *   whatever its `status`, because the question is almost always "why is this NOT here", and the
 *   refusal with its `reason`, `evidence` and `gates` is the answer. Nothing here filters on
 *   `status = 'active'`.
 * - **`supports` IS THE DESCENT, and it is carried verbatim.** A link names the edge keys it was
 *   derived from (3.2), so a reader walks link to claim to `Answer` by key rather than by walking
 *   paths. An empty `STRING[]` reads back as NULL on this engine, so every list column is normalized
 *   to `[]` on the way out and a missing descent is never a null.
 * - **`evidence` and `gates` stay STRINGS.** Their content is per rule, so they are passed through as
 *   the JSON the writer stored and parsed by the caller.
 * - **NOTHING IS INVENTED.** A field the graph does not carry is `null`. Two of the contract's fields
 *   are permanently null for that reason and both are named below.
 * - **IT NEVER WRITES.** Every statement goes through `readOnlyQuery` (5.3's isolation layer 1), the
 *   same handle a plugin is given, so a write verb in this file throws with `graph trace` in the
 *   message rather than moving a row.
 *
 * WHY THE COUNTS ARE RE-READ HERE rather than through `graphCounts`. That export flushes the answer
 * log first and waits out the pass it wakes, which WRITES: it is the right answer for
 * `?export=answers`, where a caller wants the graph current, and the wrong one for a panel whose
 * whole claim is that looking at the graph does not change it. The trace reads the tables where they
 * stand.
 *
 * THE FOUR EMPTY ANSWERS ARE FOUR DIFFERENT FACTS (`reason`), and telling them apart is the single
 * most useful thing the panel does: `not-enabled` (the flag is down, so there is no engine at all),
 * `graph-empty` (an engine with nothing in it), `no-row` (the uri names no `Media` row) and
 * `no-cluster` (a row that no pass has clustered yet). A panel that answered "nothing" to all four
 * would send every reader to read the ingest.
