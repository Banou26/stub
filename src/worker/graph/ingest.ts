/**
 * The ingest: `Answer` rows become `Media`, `Episode`, `Origin`, `CLAIMS`, `HAS_EPISODE`,
 * `EPISODE_CLAIMS`, `RELATED` and `ABOUT` (section 4 of the representation design).
 *
 * ONE FUNCTION, `ingestAnswers`, and both callers feed it the same thing. The live hook reaches it
 * through the log's sink (`./answers.ts`), with the rows that flush wrote; a replay reaches it
 * through `replayAnswers` with rows read off a dump. There is no second code path, which is what
 * makes a recorded season replayable at all: what a page did and what a file replays are the same
 * decomposition, the same merge and the same statements.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROMISES.
 * - Every row it can address lands, and the ones it cannot are in `report.quarantined` with a reason.
 *   A malformed row never rejects the batch: on 2026-09-05 one bare row in `handles` made the shared
 *   insert batch reject for every extractor in it, first-party sources included, and the whole
 *   decomposition is total for that reason (4.2 step 1).
 * - Replaying a batch that already landed writes nothing, changes nothing and emits nothing. Newness
 *   is decided by content: a row's `hash` over its merged fields, a claim's key over its pair.
 * - It never invents a fact. Only the origin that owns a uri writes that uri's `raw`; every other
 *   mention of it is a placeholder plus a claim carrying the claimer's own description (4.3).
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES.
 * - `provenance: 'ask'`. An `ask` claim is the app consumer's, not a resolver's: it goes through
 *   `upsertMedia([], [claim])` with no row and therefore no `Answer`, so nothing in the log expresses
 *   it and step 4 writes it with the `Ask` row it belongs to. `address` IS written here, from the
 *   handle's own stamp or from `NATIVE_ID_SPACES` when a recording predates it (`provenanceOf`).
 * - Everything a plugin writes (2.2). The tables exist and this file never touches them.
 *
 * THE ENGINE FACTS THAT SHAPE EVERY WRITE, all measured on 0.20.4, 2026-09-12. Three of them, and
 * each one rejects or corrupts a whole batch rather than one row.
 *
 * - A param binds by JS type and a column refuses an implicit cast, so an `UNWIND` batch whose
 *   `episodeCount` is null in EVERY row binds that field as STRING and the statement dies with "has
 *   data type STRING but expected INT64". Worse, a mixed list mis-binds silently: a DOUBLE field
 *   holding `0.5` in one row and the integer `3` in the next reads back as `1.5e-323`, the bit
 *   pattern of 3 read as a double. So EVERY typed scalar travels as a STRING and is cast in the
 *   statement, which parses rather than reinterprets and carries a null through as a null. An INT64
 *   is only offered a SAFE integer, because `String(1e21)` is `1e+21` and the cast refuses it.
 * - AN `UNWIND` STRUCT FIELD IS TYPED FROM THE FIRST ROW ONLY. A list field that is empty in row one
 *   and filled in row two binds as `LIST(ANY)` and the statement dies at RUNTIME with "Trying to
 *   create a vector with ANY type", after the binder passed it; `cast(... AS STRING[])` does not
 *   save it, and the reverse order works, which is what made it look like a data problem. It cost a
 *   real page 148 of its 816 answers before the browser arm caught it. So no list travels as a list:
 *   every one is joined into a STRING and split in the statement, where the type is written down.
 * - An object param binds as a STRUCT and a `MAP` column refuses it, so `fieldSeq` is written
 *   `map(<keys>, <values>)` over two split lists.

 * 1. `seed`, unchanged, so the seed's placeholders keep the class the precedence order gives them.
 * 2. `address` from the handle's OWN STAMP. `buildHandlesFromUri` writes it on every handle it mints
 *    (`sources/utils.ts`): the address names WHICH sources to ask and asserts nothing about how their
 *    rows relate, so the claim is a pointer. `plugin:direct` returns nothing for it and guard 3
 *    refuses any proposal it supports (3.3, 5.2).
 * 3. `address` DERIVED, for a claim carrying no stamp from a claimer that REBUILDS handles out of the
 *    asked uri (`ADDRESS_ECHOING_ORIGINS`), when the target's origin is outside the claimer's own set
 *    (`NATIVE_ID_SPACES`): a source whose own data cannot carry that id space, asked about an address
 *    that names it, is echoing the address back. Netflix publishes no AniList id anywhere, so `nf`
 *    naming `anilist:X` came from the uri it was asked about and nowhere else.
 *
 * THREE EXEMPTIONS inside rule 3, and each is a claim that CANNOT be an echo however unfamiliar the
 * target looks. A claimer that never reads the address: the premise does not hold, so the honest
 * reading is a mapping path nobody read rather than a rebroadcast, and `source` stands. A claim into
 * the claimer's OWN origin, since `buildHandlesFromUri` skips the caller's origin outright. And any
 * kind but `SAME_AS`, since that is the only relation it mints: JustWatch's `PART_OF` offers are its
 * own reading of a deep link (`justwatch/extractor.ts:400`), and unogs listing its own seasons as
 * `INCLUDES` (4.6) is a statement too.
 *
 * RULE 3 IS NOT BELT AND BRACES. Every recorded answer predates the stamp and a remote plugin source
 * may never send one, so without it the rule would apply to nothing already on disk: 89 of Netflix's
 * 156 handle-carrying `media` answers on the recorded season corpus are pure echoes, and 31 of
 * Crunchyroll's 52 (2026-09-12). It narrows only origins whose extractor was read line by line, and
 * an origin missing from either table is trusted.
 *
 * `ask` is still a later step and is never stamped here: it goes through `upsertMedia([], [claim])`
 * with no row and therefore no `Answer`, so nothing in the log expresses it.
