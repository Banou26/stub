/**
 * THE READ PATH of section 6, behind `?store=graph`.
 *
 * Every export here is a LOOKUP: it reads JSON that `plugin:aggregate` and `plugin:containment`
 * materialized, and writes nothing. No id is minted, no alias is written, nothing is unioned, and
 * the fuzzy title pass does not run inside a page read any more: that is `plugin:title`, woken by
 * the scheduler.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, rather than living in `../resolvers/media/index.ts`. That module
 * reaches urql and, through it, a CommonJS `require('react')` no alias intercepts, so it cannot be
 * imported under vitest (`vitest.config.ts` records the measurement). Nothing here imports a resolver
 * or `../extractor.ts`, so every rule below is pinned by `tests/unit/worker/graph/read.test.ts`
 * against a real engine. The resolvers become thin switches on the read store.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROMISES.
 * - A page is at most two statements, an episode list exactly one, and a detail view five: a member
 *   resolve, a `published` scan, a `Cluster` id lookup, an `Alias` lookup, then the view. A live one
 *   costs a sixth for its member uris. Those figures are asserted rather than claimed
 *   (`read.test.ts`, "the statement budget"); the two-segment resolve below is the one caller that
 *   can exceed them, and no route reaches it. `placeholdersOf` is off that budget: it feeds the ask
 *   of 7.1 step 3, not the draw, and a page that never asks anything still costs what is stated.
 * - A statement never runs with an empty `UNWIND` list, which dies at runtime on this engine rather
 *   than returning nothing (the engine facts of 2026-09-12).
 * - Nothing it returns has been merged, filtered or sorted: `applyMediaFilters`, `searchRelevance`
 *   and `applyMediaSorts` are the caller's, unchanged, and run over the cards this hands back.
