// The one place the app asks `similarMedia`: on a run's page, after aggregation, per (run cluster,
// container) pair, re-asked only when the question changes.
//
// The ask lives HERE rather than inside each source's resolver because a source sees only its own
// view (kitsu has titles, a date and a count but no episode titles at handle time; justwatch would ask
// with JustWatch's numbering, the very collision under repair), asks on every operation unless it
// remembers the policy, and asks only for the pointers it happens to hold. The worker sees the whole
// cluster: the best day-precise date across members, every title, the highest-scored episode count,
// ani.zip's episode titles, and every container the run is PART_OF whatever source or fuzzy pass
// produced the edge. `Subscription.media` is the only caller, which is what keeps this off listings.
//
// Pure of the extractor on purpose: worker/extractor.ts cannot load under vitest, so the asking and
// the claiming are here and the resolver only wires them.
//
// Every question that is SENT, and what it came to, goes into the `Ask` log (`./graph/asks.ts`,
// section 7.3) behind the `?graph` flag, so a page with no Crunchyroll button can say whether the
// origin was never asked, asked and refused, or asked and declined. The log is fire and forget and
// changes nothing the consumer does: see `note`.
//
// An answer the consumer ACCEPTS is additionally written into the graph as a claim stamped
// `provenance: 'ask'` (3.3, 4.4, migration step 4): `SAME_AS` for an answer that IS the run, `PART_OF`
// for a `containing` answer that merely holds it. The log row is not the claim and the claim is not
// the log row: a declined or refused ask writes its row and no claim, which is how "asked and turned
// down" stays a different fact from "never asked". See `claim`.
