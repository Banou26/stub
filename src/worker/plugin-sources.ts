 * is what the example plugin and every plugin written before this sends.
 *
 * A source in a family is an ordinary standalone source that happens to arrive over a shared
 * connection. So a malformed one is REPORTED and skipped, never fatal to its siblings: the same rule
 * the fan-out follows for a failing extractor and the source layer follows for a bad record. Dropping
 * the whole family because one entry is wrong would make a package strictly more fragile than the
