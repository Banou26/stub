// What is happening at the TOP of the call, made available to every source at the bottom of it.
//
// A source is handed `media(input: { uri })` and cannot tell whether a person is looking at that one
// media or whether it is one row of a listing that will never be read. So it does the same work either
// way, and the expensive answer is right in one case and wasted in the other. justwatch's search is
// the live instance: `mediaPage` maps every result through `normalizeMedia`, which reaches
// `buildOffersAsHandles`, which calls into Crunchyroll once per film result to turn a /watch/ url into
// a series id (justwatch/extractor.ts:305). Nothing on a search results page needs that id.
//
// This module is the registry and the wire format. It deliberately imports NOTHING from the worker or
// the store, so it stays importable under vitest: `worker/extractor.ts` is not, because it imports
// `Client` from urql and through it react.
//
// WHY IT RIDES IN THE VARIABLES, which looks like the clumsiest of the three options and is the only
// one that works. Two channels were measured on this machine and both are unusable:
//
//   a REQUEST HEADER throws. Header values are ByteStrings, and the context has to identify the root,
//   which for a search means user text: `new Request(url, { headers: { x: '{"search":"進撃の巨人"}' } })`
//   raises `Cannot convert argument to a ByteString because the character at index 11 has a value of 3`.
//
//   urql's OPERATION CONTEXT does not vary the operation key. `createRequest` keys on document plus
//   variables only, so two concurrent roots with the same query and variables collapse onto one
//   operation and the first one's context is the one every subscriber gets. Measured: identical
//   variables give an identical key, one extra variable changes it.
//
// So the token below is load bearing twice over. It is the join key into this registry, AND it is a
// variable, which is what stops two roots sharing one context.
