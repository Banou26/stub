/**
 * The LARGE variant of a MyAnimeList image url, or the url unchanged when it is not one.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-06: the plain spelling is 225x318 and the `l` spelling is 425x600, nearly four
 * times the pixels, and the `l` file existed for every image sampled from the shipped bundle. Both
 * the manami bundle (`picture`) and jikan's season scrape (the page's `data-src`) hand over the plain
 * one, and jikan scores 0.9, above every other source, so its small cover sorted FIRST and replaced
 * AniList's larger one several seconds after the page had already drawn it. The owner saw exactly
 * that: "the cards image load fast and are really high quality, and then 5s later, the images changes
 * for a lower quality version".
 *
 * A size letter already present is replaced rather than appended, so `...158340t.jpg` (the thumbnail
 * MAL uses in listings) upgrades too and `...158340l.jpg` is returned as it came. A missing url passes
 * through: a source with no image is not this function's problem.
