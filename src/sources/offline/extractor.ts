// a site you can go to, for what is actually a table compiled at build time.
//
// But know what actually keeps this out of the UI, because it is NOT the missing icon.
// `media-modal.tsx:662` really does render the origin row as `if (!origin.icon) return undefined`,
// and that check is real, but it is unreachable from here: `isApiOnly` below is true, and all three
// `originPage` consumers pass `OriginFilter.IsNotApiOnly`, which `db.ts:144-146` resolves to keeping
// only `!isApiOnly`. Kitsu is `isApiOnly = true` too, so it is absent from that row as well. So the
// icon is dead weight rather than a hazard, and nobody should later treat its absence as the guard.
//
// `metadataOnly` gates nothing at all, for anybody: `normalizeOrigin` drops it, it is not in the
// GraphQL schema, and the one value read of it feeds a field nothing consumes.
//
// `originUrl` is never rendered anywhere, so it carries no weight in the UI. It names the database
// that supplies the seasonal listings, which is the visible half. It is NOT the attribution: this
// source merges TWO upstreams with different licenses, manami under ODbL and @kawaiioverflow/arm
// under MIT, and one string cannot credit both. Both are named in the header of every generated
// artifact, in its `sources` field, which is the attribution of record.

/**
 * TWO HALVES, and only one of them touches the network.
 *
 * The BUNDLED half is the two generated modules below, compiled into the app and answered from
 * memory. It is the source that survives every other source failing at once, which is not
 * hypothetical: on 2026-08-16 the homepage rendered "Current season" with zero media because AniList
 * answered 403 and Jikan 504 at the same time, with the user's connection perfectly healthy. It is
 * still what every resolver here yields FIRST.
 *
 * The SEEDED half is ./seed-source.ts, a release asset walked from the live sources on a schedule and
 * fetched at runtime through the relay. It is a network request and it can fail. Every one of its
 * failure paths resolves to undefined and leaves the bundled answer exactly as it was: a timeout, a
 * 404 before the first publish, a body that is not gzip, a payload the gate refuses. Nothing here may
 * be written so that a bad seed makes the page worse than no seed.
 *
 * READ THE NAME CAREFULLY. "offline" describes the bundled DATA, an offline database in the sense its
 * upstream uses the word, compiled in rather than queried. It does NOT mean stub works offline. stub
 * has no service worker and no Cache Storage (grepped, with a control), so those bundles arrive over
 * the same network as every other chunk and are just as unavailable to a disconnected user, and the
 * seed asset is a plain fetch on top. What this survives is an UPSTREAM outage, which is the failure
 * that actually happened. If stub ever does gain a worker, this source becomes the offline catalogue
 * for real, but that is a separate piece of work and nothing here should be read as having done it.
 *
 * TWO bundles, loaded independently, because they are wanted at different moments. The homepage
 * needs seasons and never the index; opening one show needs the index and never the seasons. Split
 * this way a visitor who only browses the season row never fetches the 114 KB id table.
