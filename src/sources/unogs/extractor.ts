 *
 * TITLE PICKS THE SHOW, DATE PICKS THE RUN, the rule every other catalogue gate in this tree already
 * runs on (../catalogue-gate.ts). Nothing about the title axis moved to make room for this:
 * TITLE_MATCH_THRESHOLD stays 0.44, calibrated over 243194 correct pairs against 139507 wrong ones,
 * and no threshold could have caught these anyway. Scored with the runs' own recorded titles, The
 * Monkey King reaches 0.7164 against Monkey King and the Madoka compilation 0.7021 against the fourth
 * film, both of them ABOVE the 0.505 that "Cowboy Bebop" scores against "Cowboy Bebop: The Movie",
 * the correct match the threshold is pinned on. There is no number on this axis that separates them.
 *
 * FILMS ONLY, and that is what the payload MEANS rather than caution. unOGS publishes one year per
 * title. On a film that year is the work's. On a series it is the whole TITLE's, which is its first
 * season's, so read as this run's year it would veto the very season that holds the run:
 * `netflixCandidates` below offers it to season 1 alone for exactly that reason, and
 * `yearAppearsInShow` carries what a show-level year does to season-to-parent links (admits 16.543%
 * where season-level membership admits 93.221%).
 *
 * REFUSED BEFORE THE RANKING, never after. `pickTitleMatch` keeps the best scorer, so a wrongly dated
 * candidate left in the list can outscore the right one and take the link with it.
 *
 * SILENCE NEVER BLOCKS. A candidate with no year, or a run whose cluster names no year yet, passes
 * exactly as before: a refusal on absent evidence would drop the link for every run whose date has not
 * landed on the tick its title did, and `graph.link` has no inverse in either direction.
