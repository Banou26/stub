// Netflix's OWN data endpoint: the one www.netflix.com's public title pages call for their season and
// episode lists. It is NOT a documented or supported API, nobody publishes a contract for it, and it
// can change shape or disappear without notice. Everything below is written so that a change says so
// instead of quietly becoming an empty answer, because an empty answer here reads as "this title has
// no episodes" and that claim welds runs together downstream.
//
// Measured 2026-09-12 against www.netflix.com, anonymous, no cookie: HTTP 200, 41 KB, 0.52 to 0.54 s
// over five runs. CORS is open (OPTIONS answers 200 with access-control-allow-origin: *, and a POST
// carrying Origin: https://stub.moe is answered with that origin reflected), so a browser can make
// this call.
//
// AND IT HAS TO BE THE BROWSER THAT MAKES IT. Netflix answers per COUNTRY, about the address the
// request came from, so this is the one host in the app whose `ctx.fetch` does not go through the FKN
// relay: the relay would answer correctly about the relay's country and the page is about the
// viewer's. `src/worker/direct-fetch.ts` holds the routing, the measurement and what the exception
// costs. Until 2026-09-13 these two calls went over the relay and this whole slice published nothing
// on any page load, while the log read `no-episodes-listed`, which named Netflix for a fault that was
// ours.

 * per-viewer field must not become an outage.

/**
 * Every episode of one Netflix SEASON, by the season's own video id (unOGS republishes it as `seasid`
 * and the landing query answers it as `seasons.edges[].node.videoId`).
 *
 * NO CREDENTIALS, EVER, for the reason on `fetchNetflixTitle`: the call works anonymously and the
 * viewer may well be signed in to Netflix in the browser this runs in.
 *
 * PARTIAL ERRORS ARE SUCCESS. Every logged-out call answers 200 with one `UNAUTHENTICATED` error per
 * episode for `bookmark` and `playlistActions`, and the season is complete beside them (`readErrors`).
 *
 * REFUSES: a stale persisted query, a non-success status, a GraphQL error that is not per-viewer
 * watch state, a body it cannot parse, and a request that never arrived, each as its own `failure`.
 * Returns `{ ok: true, episodes: [] }` when Netflix knows no such season id, which is an answer.
