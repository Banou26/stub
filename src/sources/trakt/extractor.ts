/**
 * The handles a trakt id block is worth minting.
 *
 * Everything this source mints is CONTAINER: it reads `/shows/` and `/search/show` only, so a row is
 * trakt's show slug and the ids on it are the show's, identical for every season. There is no movie
 * branch here to reason about separately.
 *
 * `tmdb` IS NOT MINTED, for the two reasons simkl and watchmode already refuse it.
 *
 * IT IS A SHOW LEVEL ID. `ids.tmdb` on a trakt show is one TMDB tv id covering every season, while
 * `tmdb/extractor.ts` mints season scoped `tmdb:<id>-s<n>` runs through `seasonScopedId`. A handle is
 * an identity claim, so a bare `tmdb:<id>` says every season of the show is one media and
 * `upsertMedia` unions them on it before any season mechanism is consulted. The CONTAINER stamp this
 * used to carry does not save it, because tmdb is not in the store's show level backstop
 * (`SHOW_LEVEL_ORIGINS` is imdb alone) and a claim minted under an origin that also mints honest
 * season ids has to stand on its own.
 *
 * THE NUMBER IS AMBIGUOUS ANYWAY. TMDB numbers films and shows in separate sequences that both start
 * at 1, measured 2026-09-04: `themoviedb.org/movie/550` is Fight Club and `themoviedb.org/tv/550` is
 * Till Death Us Do Part. Stub's uri is `tmdb:550` for both, carrying no kind, so a tv id minted here
 * can weld a show to an unrelated film that holds the same number.
 *
 * `tmdb` deliberately stays OUT of `SHOW_LEVEL_ORIGINS` for this: exempting the origin would demote
 * `tmdb/extractor.ts`'s correct `<id>-s<n>` runs to fix a bare id minted somewhere else. The refusal
 * belongs at the source that cannot build an honest id, which is this one.
 *
 * The cost is the TMDB link disappearing from a trakt sourced media, the same trade simkl records.
 * `imdb` stays: a `tt` id names the show, it has no season level equivalent, and CONTAINER says so at
 * the point the claim is made rather than leaving it to the backstop.
