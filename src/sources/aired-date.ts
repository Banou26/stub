/**
 * The date a media actually started or ended, preferring AniList's own `startDate` over its airing
 * schedule, and never trusting the schedule's array ORDER.
 *
 * This read `airingSchedule.edges.at(0)` and `.at(-1)`, which is wrong twice over.
 *
 *   - `airingSchedule` lists what AniList has SCHEDULED, which for a mid-season show is the episodes
 *     still to come. `at(0)` is then the NEXT episode rather than the first, so the media's start date
 *     is a date in the future, off by however far into its run the show is. Measured over a 333 record
 *     sample: precise but wrong on 7 of them, by 4 to 1001 days.
 *   - A show that finished airing often has no schedule left at all, so `at(0)` is undefined and the
 *     media went out with NO start date. That was 42% of entries, and it is not a cosmetic gap:
 *     profileCluster derives its `years` from startDate and fuzzyMergeMediaClusters only compares
 *     clusters that share a year, so a cluster with no date is never compared with anything and
 *     silently never merges.
 *
 * `media.startDate` is a FuzzyDate whose members are individually nullable, and it was already in the
 * query, feeding only matchSeasonByDate. A complete one wins outright. An incomplete one is worth less
 * than a real airing date, so the schedule is tried next, by EPISODE NUMBER and then by earliest time,
 * never by position. Only if both fail does the partial date go out, coerced the way every other
 * source coerces one, because a year alone still buckets correctly and is what the January 1 shape
 * means everywhere else in this codebase.
