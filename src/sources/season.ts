// Season identity for sources that model a SHOW where stub models a season.
//
// TMDB, JustWatch, IMDb and TVmaze all describe a series as one entity with seasons hanging off it.

// hands the same id back for every season, and clustering union-finds them into a single media. That
// is what merged all three Mushoku Tensei seasons, and what made picking season 2 out of search open
// season 3.
//
// Split into its own module with NO imports so it can be tested: an extractor pulls in the source
// barrel and, through it, a CommonJS `require('react')` that cannot load outside a browser.

 * MEASURED 2026-09-01 over 33 real multi-season Netflix series and the 105 anime runs that clear the
 * source's own title gate, by `scripts/measure-unogs-season-match.probe.ts`. A weld is one of our runs

 *
 * The tolerance in between was swept rather than guessed, floor 0 to 3 episodes against a share of 0
 * to 1 of the run's length, and it buys assignments at about 1.6 per extra weld the whole way. That
 * exchange rate is not worth taking when one side is permanent and the other is a missing streaming
 * row, so the allowance is zero. 48 of those 105 runs hit a tie on count alone, which is why the
 * title has to be tried first and why this refuses so much: the axis is genuinely ambiguous for
 * nearly half the population.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DO. A run can match one season exactly and uniquely while three OTHER runs of the
 * same show match it too, and this function sees one run at a time. That residue (11 of 105) is the
 * same one catalogue-gate.ts records: a source matching a season cluster to a catalogue that models
 * shows has no view of the other clusters, and it cannot be closed here.

/**
 * Whether a start date is precise enough to pick a RUN with, as opposed to naming a year.
 *
 * Seven extractors BUILD a date out of a bare year and template it as January 1: justwatch, omdb,
 * tmdb, tvdb, unogs (twice) and crunchyroll's own show-level media all do it, and nothing downstream
 * can tell one of those from a show that really did premiere on New Year's Day. kitsu and jikan do
 * the softer version, answering `YYYY-MM-01` whenever only the month is known, which is up to 30 days
 * out while reading as exact.
 *
 * Against a 45 day window that is not a rounding error, it is the difference between naming a cour
 * and naming a year, so a coerced date has to be refused rather than matched. Refusing costs a source
 * its link; accepting welds it to whichever run happens to sit nearest a date nobody asserted.
 *
 * This is the same reasoning, and the same two shapes, that `startDay` in worker/store/fuzzy-merge.ts
 * drops before comparing two clusters. It lives here rather than there because this module imports
 * nothing, so an extractor can read it without dragging the store in.
 *
 * A genuine first-of-month premiere is refused too. That is the safe direction: the caller simply
 * does not get a season-scoped handle, which is where it was before it asked.
 *
 * READS THE UTC DAY, so hand it a UTC or ISO string. A date built with `new Date(y, m, d)` is LOCAL
 * midnight, and anilist/extractor.ts builds exactly that before calling `.toUTCString()`, so east of
 * UTC a local January 1 is December 31 in UTC and would slip past this check. Everything that reaches
 * here today is an upstream `YYYY-MM-DD` or an ISO string, which parses as UTC; the trap is worth
 * knowing before this is pointed at a locally-constructed date.
