 * The day an episode card names, as `YYYY-MM-DD`, or undefined when it names none this can read.
 *
 * TMDB dates a card in a LOCALIZED LONG FORM and SPACE PADS the day to two columns, so the season
 * page carries both `July 10, 2023` and `August  7, 2023` with two spaces (measured 2026-09-12 on
 * /tv/94664/season/2: 24 cards, all dated, 8 of them padded). Any separating whitespace is therefore
 * accepted, and nothing else is.
 *
 * IT REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES, which is why `new Date(text)` is not used even though V8 happens to
 * parse this shape: that reads the string in the RUNTIME's zone, so the day it returns is not the day
 * the page named anywhere west of Greenwich, and it accepts enough near-misses (a day of 31 in a 30
 * day month, a month name it half-recognises) to turn an unreadable card into a confident wrong date.
 * A day is emitted as a DAY, never widened to an instant, for the reason ../../utils/release-date.ts
 * records.
