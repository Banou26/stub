 * The video handle, with every `currentTime` write mirrored onto Crunchyroll's own scrubber.
 *
 * Lives in a module of its own, with no React in it, because it is the one genuinely new mechanism in
 * the player and the only part of it a unit test can reach. Anything importing the player components
 * pulls a CommonJS `require('react')` that `resolve.alias` cannot intercept (see `vitest.config.ts`),
 * so a test that reached this through the component tree could not run at all.
 *
 * @fkn/lib's RemoteVideoElement already satisfies video.js v10's structural media contract, so the
 * proxy adds a side effect and changes nothing about the shape.
