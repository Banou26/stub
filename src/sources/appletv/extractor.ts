 * all of them. Same defect TMDB, TVmaze and JustWatch had, same '-s<n>' fix.
 *
 * A show-level id is still minted for SEARCH, where there is no cluster to corrupt and Apple TV
 * genuinely is describing the show, which is the same fork tvmaze/extractor.ts draws.
 *
 * A MOVIE takes the bare id and keeps it, exactly as JustWatch's `showRequiresSeason` allows: it has

 * `Severance` answers with eleven episodes running 1x5 through 2x6:
 *
 *   curl -s 'https://uts-api.itunes.apple.com/uts/v3/shows/umc.cmc.1srk2goyh2q2zdxcx605w8vtx/episodes?selectedSeasonId=umc.cmc.uhm560ns0yg3a5fy454bb967&caller=web&sf=143441&v=58&pfm=web&locale=en-US&utsk=0'

 * Measured 2026-08-29 over 150 seasons of 83 shows reachable from UTS search, one request per season:
 * 335 of the 1228 episodes returned (27.280%) belong to a season other than the one requested, and 67
 * of the 150 requests (44.667%) return at least one. So this source flattening every season's request
 * together, as it did, produced a list that was both duplicated and cross-season; the dedupe by id is
 * for the same reason, since a window can return an episode a neighbouring window already returned.
 *
 * There is no way to ask for the rest: `nextToken` is answered with `400 If nextToken is specified,
 * nextToken should be specified and non-negative` whatever value it is given, so a long season comes
 * back partial and that is the ceiling, not a bug to work around here.
