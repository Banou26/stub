// two cours into one season, JustWatch numbers by its own list, anime metadata says "Season 2 Part 2"),

// with no inverse. What may go on a union is VERIFIED sameness, and this module is where verification
// is defined: a caller describes its run, a source describes its seasons, and the pick below either
// establishes one season or refuses.
//
// The rules decide WHICH season of a show and never WHICH show: the show id the caller holds settles
// that, and it came off a PART_OF edge whose container cluster the fuzzy title pass may have unioned
// on a listing. A wrong container union upstream is trusted here, so a pick is only as right as it.

/**
 * The one season of a show that HOLDS the caller's run without being it, or undefined (4.4).
 *
 * This is the other half of the fold, and it exists because `foldVetoed` is right and unhelpful on its
 * own: Netflix's season 1 of Mushoku Tensei is 24 episodes over anime's 11 and 12, so `pickSimilarSeason`
 * refuses the only season either run could match, correctly, and the run is then left with no Netflix
 * anything. A season longer than the run is not the run; it may still be where the run is.
 *
 * IT IS NEVER SAMENESS AND CANNOT BECOME IT. The first thing it does is run `pickSimilarSeason`: a run
 * that HAS a season is never also given a container, so the two answers are mutually exclusive by
 * construction rather than by the caller remembering to ask in the right order. A caller writes a
 * `containing` answer as `PART_OF` and never as `SAME_AS` (`worker/similar-consumer.ts`), which is why
 * a wrong answer here costs a badge and a hidden card where a wrong sameness welds two works.
 *
 * WHAT IT REQUIRES, and each one is a way the count alone lies.
 *
 * - BOTH COUNTS, and a candidate STRICTLY LONGER than the run. A season whose length is unknown (a
 *   truncated listing, an unaired season) could be any length at all, and one no longer than the run
 *   has no room to hold it and something else.
 * - AN ORDINAL CEILING, when the titles agree on a season number and name no part: a fold only ever
 *   compresses, so the container's own ordinal is at or below ours. This is the direction of the
 *   2026-09-05 weld, anime season 1 landing on `nf:80987039-3`, closed here rather than left to a
 *   count. A part-named run is exempt, because a part is a position INSIDE a season and its number is
 *   not a season ordinal at all: "Part 2" of anime season 1 lives in Netflix's season 1.
 * - THEN ONE OF TWO AXES, in order, each of which must single out EXACTLY ONE candidate.
 *
 * AXIS 1, EPISODE TITLES, decisive wherever it can measure: at least `MIN_EPISODE_TITLE_MATCHES` of
 * the candidate's real episode titles are ours, they cover at least `EPISODE_TITLE_COVERAGE` of OUR
 * run, and they cover LESS than `EPISODE_TITLE_COVERAGE` of the candidate. That is rule 2's own
 * measurement read from both sides at once: above the line against our run means it holds the run,
 * below the line against the candidate means it holds more than the run, and a candidate above the
 * line on both is the sameness rule 2 would already have taken. A fold of two equal cours scores
 * 12/24 = 0.50 against the candidate and 12/12 = 1.00 against the run, which is exactly the shape.
 *
 * BOTH SHARES ARE MEASURED AGAINST COUNTS, and neither against a title list, which is where this
 * differs from rule 2 and has to. Against the run, because the caller sends every title of every
 * episode in every language it holds (`runEvidence`) and a set three times the run's length would put
 * every share below any threshold. Against the CANDIDATE, because a listing names only some of a
 * season's episodes: unOGS gives Netflix's season 2 of Mushoku Tensei 14 real names over its 25
 * episodes, so the 13 an anime run matches score 13/14 = 0.93 against the names and 13/25 = 0.52
 * against the season. The first reads as identity and is how a fold gets called a match; only the
 * second is a statement about the season.
 *
 * A measured candidate that fails is REMOVED, as in rule 2: a season listing real episode titles, none
 * of which are ours, is not where our run is. What is left for axis 2 is the seasons nothing could be
 * measured about, which is the common Netflix case: `nf:80987039-1` titles all 23 of its episodes
 * `Episode N` and one `Special Episode`, so it carries ONE real title and is unmeasurable, while
 * `nf:80987039-2` carries 24 and can be both measured and refuted.
 *
 * AXIS 2, YEAR: the one candidate dated our year, holding more than `1 / EPISODE_TITLE_COVERAGE` of
 * our run. The first half is rule 4 with the fold veto inverted, the very veto that refused the pick:
 * the one season dated our year, turned down only for being longer than the run, is the season the run
 * is in. The second half is the same constant as axis 1 with the containment premise standing in for
 * the matches it cannot make: if the container holds our run then our count IS the matched count, so
 * `ours / theirs` is the coverage against the candidate, and it has to be below the line for the same
 * reason. It is what tells a fold from a season carrying our run plus a bonus block, 12/16 = 0.75,
 * which is the shape rule 2 admits as SAMENESS when it can see the titles; with only counts to go on
 * the two are indistinguishable, so nothing is answered rather than a container that is really the run.
 *
 * AXIS 2 ALSO REQUIRES EVERY SIBLING TO CARRY A COUNT, at or below the ceiling, because "turned down
 * only for being longer" is a statement about the OTHER candidates and a season nobody measured was
 * turned down for something else. The clause and what it was measured against are on the line itself.
 *
 * The year is the weakest thing here and it is only ever offered by a source that knows what it means:
 * unOGS publishes one year for a whole title, which is its FIRST season's, and `netflixCandidates`
 * hands it to season 1 alone for that reason. So "dated our year" reads as "our run started in the
 * year this source's first season did", which is true of every cour a first season folded in.
