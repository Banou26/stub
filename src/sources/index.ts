// Watchmode was DISABLED on 2026-09-04 and is back on 2026-09-05, unchanged in what it knows and
// changed in what it claims. Every provider handle it mints is show level, because its record is a
// show and it has no season concept anywhere in the file. As SAME_AS each of those welded two runs
// together, and refusing them individually left it contributing nothing, so it was unplugged.
//
// It now mints them PART_OF: the url survives, the claim does not. That is what this source was always
// for. See `MediaHandleRelation` in worker/resolvers/media/schema.gql.
