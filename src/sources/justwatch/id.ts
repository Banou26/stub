// imports the crunchyroll extractor and the source barrel, which cannot be loaded outside a browser.
//
// JustWatch has no season-level node. 'ts222366' is Mushoku Tensei entire, seasons 1 through 3 hanging
// off one id, and its provider deep links are show-level too (a hulu.com/series/<uuid> url names the
// show). Stub has no notion of a show - every media here is ONE season - so a show-level id lands on
// all of them and union-finds them into a single media. That was visible three ways: picking season 2
// out of search opened season 3, an aggregated uri carried two anilist ids and two mal ids at once,
// and two unrelated shows merged once a shared handle bridged their clusters.
//
// So the rule is absolute: a series media is `<node>-<season>`, never the bare node id.
//
// The suffix is the SEASON'S OWN objectId, not its ordinal. JustWatch gives every season one
// (Mushoku Tensei is 222366 with seasons 230388, 378206, 490814), so this is a real id in their space
// rather than a position in a list - it does not move when a season is renumbered, split into cours,
// or has a recap inserted ahead of it, all of which happen and all of which would otherwise silently
// repoint an existing uri at different episodes.

 * suffix wrote JUSTWATCH'S season number into the provider's id space (`nf:80123-2`,
 * `appletv:<umc>-s2`), where unogs and the appletv source mint the same shapes with the PROVIDER'S
 * numbering, and the two numberings do not agree: Netflix folds two anime cours into one season, so
 * its season 2 and JustWatch's season 2 name different runs under one uri, and `graph.link` has no
 * inverse. A show-level offer is therefore a container (`buildOffersAsHandles` hangs the run under it
 * as PART_OF), and the precise run comes from `similarMedia`, asked of the provider's own source on
 * the run's page with evidence about the run. A film's bare id is exact and stays an identity.
 *
 * Crunchyroll is refused OUTRIGHT. `extractContentId` reads a crunchyroll id from one url shape only,
 * `/series/<id>`, so every id that reaches here is a SERIES id: it names a container that holds every
 * run of the show and, on Crunchyroll, the show's FILMS too, since a film belonging to a running series
 * is published under the series. The extractor demotes that id to PART_OF itself; a film whose offer
 * was a /series/ url used to take the bare container id, the same weld measured on kitsu 2026-09-04,
 * where four Demon Slayer films and fifteen Dragon Ball Z films each shared one /series/ id.
 *
 * The extractor's episode-resolving path is where a real crunchyroll handle still comes from, and it
 * has its own reason to refuse a pinned season. See `buildOffersAsHandles`.
