// The one thing this page DOES rather than reads: it asks the sources about the uri it was handed.
//
// WHY A DEBUG PAGE ASKS ANYTHING AT ALL. The graph engine is in memory for the life of the worker
// that opened it, and a full page load makes a new worker with an empty graph. So a trace url pasted
// into a bug report always arrives cold: it answered `graph-empty` for every uri, every time, and the
// `not-enabled` message told the reader to reload with the flag, which produced exactly that empty
// graph. The two states formed a loop that no pasted link could escape (measured 2026-09-13), while
// the page's own intro promised "it rides in the url, so this page can be linked into a bug report".
//
// So the page warms what it was asked about, the same way the media view warms it: one `media(uri)`
// subscription, which is what makes the worker fan out to the sources, which is what the ingest tee
// writes into the graph, which is what a pass then clusters. Then it traces again.
//
// ITS OWN DOCUMENT, NOT THE MODAL'S. `src/router/home/media-modal.tsx` cannot be imported outside a
// browser build at all (it reaches @floating-ui/react, which resolves `react` through vite's preact
// alias, so a test importing it dies on a missing package: `tests/unit/router/modal-media.test.ts`
// records the measurement). Reaching for its document would drag that whole module in. This one is
// narrower on purpose and asks for exactly the fields whose resolvers fan out: the handles, so every
// origin claiming this work is asked, and the episodes, so their lists arrive too. Nothing here is
// rendered, so a field that exists only for drawing is a request nobody reads.

 * trace that is still honest about being empty. It resolves with whatever progress it reached.
 *
 * The document goes through `handleRequest`, which is the function urql's own fetch exchange calls
 * (`src/urql.ts`), so this is the app's read path and not a second one. The worker import is dynamic
 * because `src/worker.ts` spawns a Worker and awaits an osra handshake at module scope.
