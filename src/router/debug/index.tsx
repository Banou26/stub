/**
 * The graph trace page: one uri in, everything the graph believes about it out.
 *
 * Four parts, in this order, and the order is the reading order of a bug report: what was asked and
 * what it resolved to, the media graph with every link drawn including the refused ones, the episodes
 * the cluster resolved to, and an inspector that walks one edge down to the answer bytes that caused
 * it.
 *
 * DENSITY OVER BEAUTY, and honesty over both: every value comes from the bundle and a value the graph
 * does not carry renders as the word null. Nothing on this page is computed from something else, with
 * one exception that is labelled as such: the node set includes uris that only appear at the end of an
 * edge, so a refused neighbour has a box to be refused against.
 *
 * IT WARMS WHAT IT IS ASKED ABOUT, which is the one thing here that is not a read. The engine lives
 * inside one worker, a full page load makes a new one, and a pasted url therefore always arrives at
 * an empty graph: before this page asked the sources itself, a linked trace could answer nothing but
 * `graph-empty`, and the `not-enabled` message sent the reader to do the reload that produced it. So
 * an unresolved uri is fanned out through the same `media(uri)` subscription the media view drives
 * (`./warm.ts`), with the progress on screen, and re-traced as rows arrive. The re-tracing stops the
 * moment a cluster resolves, so nothing moves under a reader who has started clicking.
 *
 * The worker call is a PROP with a default rather than a module import, because `src/worker.ts`
 * spawns a Worker at module scope: injecting it is what lets the page be rendered against a hand
 * built bundle in a test, which is the only way the four `reason` messages and the refused states can
 * be pinned at all.
