 * a pass has since clustered it. `named` is a uri in NO member list that appears only at the end of a
 * claim or a link, which is what a refused neighbour looks like: it has to be drawn, or the page
 * answers "why is this not here" with a blank.
 *
 * There was a fourth, `unowned`, read as "a row another scope owns". That is a misreading of the
 * column: an unowned row IS the placeholder. It drew a fourth box style that the legend had no entry
 * for, and it is `via` (in the node's meta line) that says whether a placeholder is a cluster member.
