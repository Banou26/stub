 * Whether two uris name the same work.

 * THEY SHARE A MEMBER, and equality is never the question. An aggregated uri is a set of source
 * handles that GROWS as the store folds more sources into the cluster, and the address bar carries
 * whichever set was known when the link was made: a shared or bookmarked link routinely names more
 * sources than the home listing's own card does, `ag:(anilist:178789,cr:G24H1N3MP-GS00374452,jw:...,
 * kitsu:49002,mal:59193,nf:...,offline:mal-59193)` against the card's
 * `ag:(anilist:178789,kitsu:49002,mal:59193,offline:mal-59193)`. Compared for equality those are two
 * different works, which is how a pasted media link came to look broken (open problem 22).
 *
 * A bare `origin:id` counts as a cluster of one, so a link that names a work through a single source
 * still finds it in the listing. `matchAggregatedUris` refuses both sides that are not `ag:(...)`,
 * and that is the case this adds.
