/**
 * An episode's release date, as a person reads it.
 *
 * Answers `undefined` for anything there is nothing honest to show for: no date, or a date written in
 * a shape nothing can parse. That is the caller's signal to render nothing rather than a dash or an
 * "unknown", since most episodes of most runs carry no date at all and a column of placeholders is
 * worse than an empty one.
 *
 * THE TRAP THIS EXISTS FOR is the day boundary. A source can name a DAY with no time (anizip's
 * `airdate` is `2024-01-07`), and `new Date('2024-01-07')` is midnight UTC, so `toLocaleDateString`
 * anywhere west of Greenwich renders **January 6**: every date-only episode shows a day early for a
 * third of the world, and nothing about it looks wrong. So a date-only value is formatted in UTC,
 * where the day the source named is the day shown, while a value carrying a time is a real moment and
 * is formatted where the viewer is.
 *
 * It cannot be seen from here, which is why it is pinned rather than eyeballed: this machine is UTC+9
 * and a positive offset never crosses backwards, so the wrong version and the right one render
 * identically on it. `tests/unit/utils/release-date.test.ts` pins the zone.
 *
 * A STRING is the whole input contract, because that is what reaches a client: `Episode.releaseDate`
 * is the GraphQL `Date` scalar. A source holding epoch milliseconds converts at the extractor, where
 * the units are established (see `src/sources/catalogue-gate.ts`, which records how Apple TV's were
 * measured), rather than here where a seconds-for-milliseconds mixup would be a silent 1970.
