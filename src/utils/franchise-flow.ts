/**
 * A laid out franchise as the two lists `@xyflow/react` draws.
 *
 * The same split as `router/debug/flow.ts`, for the same reason: everything worth asserting about
 * this picture is a question about which works became boxes, which arrows joined them, which of the
 * two ARROW KINDS each one is, and what lights when the pointer is somewhere. None of that is a
 * question about pixels, and a component test here could not ask it anyway, since the suite runs
 * under linkedom and xyflow draws no edge without a box model to measure
 * (`tests/unit/components/xyflow-env.test.tsx`).
 *
 * Positions still come from `layoutFranchise`. The library does not lay out graphs, and the column
 * packing is the part with the actual thinking in it.
