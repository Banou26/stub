        Rendered unconditionally, and the failure message covers it rather than replacing it. The effect
        needs this ref to exist to mount at all, so swapping the frame out on failure would mean a source
        that failed once could never be retried, not even for a different release.

        The capabilities are granted HERE because permissions policy is read at navigation and is not
        inherited. The plugin passes the same set down to whatever it nests inside itself (ripple, for a
        torrent release), and it can only pass on what this frame was granted.

        SANDBOX FLAGS ARE THE SAME STORY and go one worse: a nested frame INHERITS this set and can only
        add to it, so a player two frames down cannot ask for anything back.

        Measured 2026-09-09 on Chrome 149, driving this frame chain against the live torrent.fkn.app
        and clicking ripple's own "Open this torrent in Ripple", one run per flag set:

          allow-scripts allow-same-origin            NOTHING HAPPENS. "Blocked opening
                                                     'https://torrent.fkn.app/?torrent=...' in a new
                                                     window because the request was made in a
                                                     sandboxed frame whose 'allow-popups' permission
                                                     is not set", in the console and nowhere else.
          + allow-popups                             the tab opens, still sandboxed: measured over the
                                                     same chain, a download is refused and a form
                                                     submit does nothing.
          + allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox           the tab opens as an ordinary page, and both work.

        So both flags are load bearing, because the player offers exactly those two links: one opens a
        page that navigates, the other saves a file.
