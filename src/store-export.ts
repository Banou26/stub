// The store export reaches a page ONLY through `?export=store`, and only as a window function: the
// schema has no field that answers "every cluster in the store" (`Subscription.mediaPage` fuzzy
// merges, hides attached containers, filters and sorts before a caller sees anything), and a query
// field would be permanent product surface plus a second copy of the store in graphcache. A flagged
// window function exists only on a page that asked for it, and its ABSENCE is what tells the exporter
// the flag never reached the app, which otherwise looks exactly like a store holding nothing.
