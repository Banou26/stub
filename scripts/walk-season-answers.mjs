/**
 * Record every source answer for a whole anime season, as a replayable corpus.
 *
 *   npm run corpus:walk -- --limit 3            # the smoke run
 *   npm run corpus:walk                         # the current season, which the owner runs
 *   npm run corpus:walk -- --season summer-2026 --resume
 *
 * WHAT IT RECORDS. One page load per run of the season, at `/media/<aggregated uri>?graph=1&export=answers`,
 * which is the same address a card on the listing links to. `?graph=1` fills the worker's `Answer`
 * log (src/worker/graph/answers.ts: every resolver return value, byte for byte, keyed by a content
 * hash) and `?export=answers` installs `window.__stubExportAnswers()` (src/answers-export.ts), which
 * hands the log back as `{key, seq, uri, origin, kind, operation, selection, raw}` rows in `seq`
 * order. The walk waits for the fan-out to settle, reads the log, and appends what it has not seen.
 *
 * THE FILE LAYOUT, under `corpus/season/<season>-<year>/`:
 *
 *   answers.jsonl   one row per line, deduped on `key` ACROSS pages, in the order the pages yielded
 *                   them. `seq` is assigned per page session, so it orders rows inside one page and
 *                   says nothing across two: `key` is the only identity, and the file's own order is
 *                   the only global one.
 *   manifest.json   the season, the walk's start and end, the app commit and version, and one entry
 *                   per run: its uri, the rows it yielded, the distinct origins, the settle time and
 *                   any page error. `origins` counts every origin that wrote a row; `answerOrigins`
 *                   counts only those that said something about the WORK, which is the number worth
 *                   reading (see THE CONTROL).
 *
 * `corpus/` is gitignored. A full season is 200 to 500 MB raw (about 800 rows of 2.5 kB per run, 223 runs
 * in summer 2026), tens once compressed, and belongs in a release asset the way the offline
 * seed ships `dist-seed`; this script only leaves the layout ready for one.
 *
 * HOW THE SEASON IS ENUMERATED, reusing what already knows:
 *
 *   current season   the LIVE home listing, opened with `?export=store` and settled, exactly as
 *                    scripts/export-season-seed.mjs enumerates its work list. Every cluster is one
 *                    run, ordered by popularity (`rankByPopularity`), and its aggregated uri is built
 *                    from its members the way `buildAggregatedIdentity` does (worker/store/aggregate.ts).
 *   another season   the bundled catalogue, `src/generated/anime-seasons.ts`, which is what the
 *                    offline source ships. The listing only ever shows the season the clock is in
 *                    (src/router/home/index.tsx pins it to `mediaSeasonNow()`), so a past or future
 *                    season has no live enumeration to reuse.
 *
 * THE CONTROL. The first page of a walk must yield rows about the WORK from at least 3 distinct
 * origins, or the walk stops and says the recording path is not working. A walk that records nothing
 * writes an empty file and would otherwise report success: an empty corpus and a broken hook look
 * identical afterwards.
 *
 * "About the work" is the load bearing half. Every source also writes ONE `kind: 'origin'` row
 * describing itself, so counting rows by origin alone reports 24 on a page where all 24 refused to
 * answer anything (measured 2026-09-12: 24 origins wrote a row, 8 of them wrote a media or episode
 * one). Proven able to fire: with `?graph=1` stripped from the navigation the first page recorded 0
 * rows, the control stopped the walk naming `graph: the answer log is off`, and the script exited 2.
 *
 * FLAGS.
 *   --season <name>-<year>   default: the season the clock is in
 *   --limit N                walk the first N runs, most popular first (the smoke run)
 *   --resume                 skip runs already in the manifest, keep the rows already recorded
 *   --fresh                  discard an existing recording of this season and start over
 *   --build                  run `vp build` first
 *   --pages N                page pool size, default 3
 *   --out <dir>              where the season directory goes, default corpus/season
 *   --quiet-ms / --floor-ms / --cap-ms / --poll-ms   the settle window, see SETTLE below
 *
 * Talks to the real sources over the network, one browser, headless and muted.
 *
 * EXIT CODES. 0 clean, 2 a control failed (the build is missing, the enumeration answered nothing,
 * the first page did not record).
