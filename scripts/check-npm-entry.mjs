// The npm entry gate, run by `npm run build` right after the two vite builds.
//
// The platform loads an npm app by appending `<script type="module" src="<entry>">` to a sandbox
// document, and the entry it reads is package.json's `main`. Nothing else in this repo observes that
// file: anime.fkn.app serves index.html, the playwright suite drives the test build, and the unit
// suite never sees build/. So 0.0.18 published a package whose `main` did not exist, every check
// stayed green, and the only symptom was a blank page at https://fkn.app/app/npm:@banou/stub.
//
// Each rule below pins one thing that was measured broken while fixing that, so a config edit that
// undoes any of them reds the build rather than the next release.
