// The header has to stay reachable over the media modal, so a follower in a watch party can reach the
// party pill and stop following while the host has a modal open.
//
// AND SO DOES WHAT THE HEADER OPENS, which is the half this check could not see until 2026-09-09. A
// menu is portalled to the body, so it competes at ROOT on its own number rather than inheriting the
// bar's 1100: the party menu (150), the account menu (400) and the party chat (145) all opened UNDER
// the modal, invisible through its 44% black and taking no clicks. Asserting on the header's own
// input stayed green through every one of them, which is what a check aimed at the button rather
// than the action buys you.
//
// A stacking order is not something a unit test can hold, so this drives the real page and asks the
// document what is on top, WITH A CONTROL for every row: the same measurement at the old z-index must
// fail. A check that cannot produce the failure would pass on any CSS at all.
//
// Usage:
//   npm run dev            # serves on 4560
//   node scripts/check-modal-header.mjs
//
// Run it from INSIDE the repo: an ESM script resolves bare specifiers against its own location.
