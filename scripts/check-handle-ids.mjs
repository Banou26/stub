/**
 * Whether any handle in a rendered cluster carries an id that is not an id in that origin's space,
 * run against a deployed origin. Not a test: it drives the live site, so it lives here and is run by
 * hand.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-handle-ids.mjs https://anime.fkn.app
 *
 * WHAT IT LOOKS AT. Aggregated uris are rendered into the page as `/media/ag:(origin:id,...)` hrefs,
 * so every handle in a cluster is readable off the DOM. Five of the origins stub links have purely
 * NUMERIC ids, so a non-numeric one there is a positional url read that returned the wrong path
 * segment. `anizip:animedb.pl` is the case this was written for: jikan read `pathname.split('/')[2]`
 * of `/perl-bin/animedb.pl` and minted the script name as an id on every record that hit it.
 *
 * THE CONTROL IS THE POSITIVE. If no `anizip:` handle is seen at all, the check has proven nothing:
 * a page that never renders one cannot show a bad one. It fails on an empty sighting for that reason.
 *
 * Headless and muted on purpose: it reads the DOM and nothing else, so it has no business taking a
 * window or making a sound on the owner's machine.
