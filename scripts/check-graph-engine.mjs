/**
 * Does the built app reach the graph engine behind `?graph`, leave it alone without it, and fill the
 * answer log from real sources?
 *
 * Three arms. The second is the control for the first: with the flag the worker must open LadybugDB
 * and fetch the 22 MB engine the vite plugin emits, and without it neither may happen, so a check
 * that only ran the first could not tell "the flag works" from "the engine loads unconditionally".
 *
 * The third opens a media page with `?graph=1&export=answers` and reads the log back through
 * `window.__stubExportAnswers`, and the graph the ingest made of it through `window.__stubGraphCounts`.
 * It is the only arm that talks to the real sources over the network, which is deliberate: the unit
 * suite drives the hook against a fixture server, and what it cannot tell you is whether 24 sources
 * answering at once produce answers the log recognises and rows the ingest can write. It reports the
 * rows, the bytes, the time and the row count of every table, since that is the cost the tee of step
 * 1b has to fit inside. A log that filled while `Media` or `CLAIMS` stayed at zero is a tee that
 * quarantined the page, which is the failure a rows-only arm cannot see.
 *
 * Run it from inside the repo, against a `vp build` output:
 *   node_modules/.bin/vp build && node scripts/check-graph-engine.mjs
