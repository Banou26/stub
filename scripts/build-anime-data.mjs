// Build the two anime data artifacts stub loads lazily, by merging two independent id databases.
//
// Runs as part of `npm run build` (see the `data:build` script). It pulls the newest
// manami-project/anime-offline-database release so a deploy always carries current data, and merges
// it with the `@kawaiioverflow/arm` npm package, which is pinned by package-lock.json.
//
//   src/generated/anime-index.ts    cross-catalog ids: MyAnimeList, AniList, Kitsu, AniDB
//   src/generated/anime-seasons.ts  seasonal listings with titles and covers
//
// Both are reached ONLY through a dynamic import, so they are separate content-hashed chunks and
// add nothing to the initial bundle.
//
// WHY TWO DATABASES RATHER THAN THE BEST ONE
//
// Not for coverage, though the union does win there (20,972 MyAnimeList to AniList pairs against
// arm's 20,754 and manami's 18,858). It is because a wrong pair is unrecoverable: the store's
// union-find has no unlink, so one bad row welds two unrelated shows together for the worker's
// lifetime and the merged cluster then goes on to weld a third through the fuzzy pass. That is the
// shape of the uNoGS Death Note incident already recorded in the knowledge base.
//
// Neither database is clean on its own, measured rather than assumed:
//
//   - manami carries 48 rows holding two ids from a SINGLE catalog, which can only mean it welded
//     two catalog entries that are not the same show. `Cosmic Break` is anilist/17295 and
//     anilist/206843 at once. Upstream's own README says the data is 65% reviewed.
//   - The two disagree outright on 12 MyAnimeList ids, so at least one is wrong in each case.
//
// Holding both is what makes those detectable at all. Either alone would assert every one of them
// silently. So a pair ships only when nothing contradicts it, and anything ambiguous is dropped.
//
// NETWORK POLICY
//
// Every build takes the newest release, so a deploy is never older than the last one published.
// Nothing generated is committed. A local build cache under node_modules/.cache keeps repeat builds
// off the network, and a CI checkout has no cache, so CI always fetches. On Cloudflare Pages the
// cache is not merely absent but unreachable: the build restores a dependency cache and THEN runs
// `npm clean-install`, which deletes node_modules, so nothing under it can ever survive into a
// build. The network paths below are the only ones that exist there.
//
// If the fetch fails with no cache to fall back on, the build FAILS rather than degrading. arm alone
// would still produce a plausible looking index, so a silent degrade would ship a build with no
// season listings and no Kitsu or AniDB ids while looking entirely healthy.
//
// The release is named through three independent paths, because they fail independently. See
// `newestRelease`: the list endpoint can answer 200 with an empty array during a GitHub incident,
// which reads as "this repo has no releases" and is not that at all, and BOTH api.github.com paths
// go down together whenever the runner's unauthenticated per-IP budget is spent, which is why the
// third one does not touch that host.
//
// LICENSING
//
// stub is MIT, and neither upstream is, so the derived data carries its own terms rather than the
// repo's. Attribution is per artifact and lists every contributor to THAT file: anime-seasons is
// manami alone, anime-index is arm and manami together. Each one repeats its credits in a header
// comment AND in a `sources` field, because ODbL section 4.2(b) wants the notice inside the
// database as well as in the documentation. data/README.md is the attribution of record and
// data/LICENSE-manami.txt is the full ODbL text.
