/**
 * Does a provider offer with no source of its own reach a run's page as a LINK and never as an
 * IDENTITY?
 *
 *   node scripts/check-part-of-links.mjs https://anime.fkn.app [query] [providerHost]
 *
 * Defaults to `Spy x Family` and `hulu.com`, chosen because Hulu has no source of its own: the only
 * way a hulu link can reach a page is JustWatch's show-level offer, and since 2026-09-05 that offer is
 * the provider's TITLE as a CONTAINER, carried PART_OF. So on the run's page the header must render
 * the hulu url, and the `ag:(...)` uri the page links to must hold no `hulu:` member: membership of an
 * aggregated uri is SAME_AS by construction, a PART_OF handle rides a directed edge and never appears
 * there. Both halves are read, because either alone proves nothing: a link with a `hulu:` member is
 * the old weld path, and no `hulu:` member with no link is a dropped offer.
 *
 * CONTROLS, each printed, and any failure exits 2 rather than reporting a result:
 *   (a) a LINK whose hostname ends with imdb.com exists on the same page. An imdb id can ONLY render
 *       through the PART_OF path (`SHOW_LEVEL_ORIGINS` in worker/store/db.ts), so its presence proves
 *       the render path this check depends on is alive.
 *   (b) a LINK whose hostname is anilist.co or kitsu.io exists, proving the header rendered its
 *       SAME_AS members at all.
 *   (c) the search returned a cluster to open.
 * A missing provider link with all three controls green is a real failure (exit 1), and the LINKS list
 * is printed so the providers that did render can be read.
 *
 * ONE PAGE LOAD, client-side navigation exactly as reproduce-season-weld.mjs does: the store lives in
 * the page's worker and a reload wipes it.
 *
 * Headless and muted: it reads the DOM and nothing else. The version line is printed first; a run
 * whose version does not match the pushed sha is discarded, not read.
