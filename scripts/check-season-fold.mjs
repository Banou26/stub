/**
 * Does a run come back holding a catalogue season that CONTAINS it?
 *
 * Crunchyroll models Mushoku Tensei season 1 as one season of 23 and a special, where AniList and MAL
 * split the same broadcast into 11 and 12. The fold premieres the same day as the first of the parts
 * it contains, so a picker matching on title and premiere takes it and the run lists both parts:
 * measured on the live site 2026-09-09, part 1 showed 24 rows for an 11 episode run.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A TEST. It did not reproduce from the url. Pasting the address showed
 * 11, correctly, in every browser and both origins. The reproduction is a NAVIGATION: the pasted
 * address already names three sources, so the cluster resolves from them, while arriving from a
 * relation gives a bare node uri and the path that fills one in is the one that searches Crunchyroll
 * by title. So the walk is the test, and the unit half is pinned in
 * tests/unit/sources/crunchyroll/extractor.test.ts.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-season-fold.mjs                      # the live site
 *   node scripts/check-season-fold.mjs http://localhost:4560 # a dev server
 *
 * THE CONTROL WAS THE UNFIXED BUILD, run against both at once on 2026-09-09: localhost answered
 * `ok  hop 2 ... (12 rows)` while anime.fkn.app answered `FAIL hop 2 ... (24 rows)` and printed the
 * `cr:G24H1N3MP-G6NQCJ9P1` handle it had gained. So this can express the failure, which is the only
 * thing that makes a passing run mean anything.
 *
 * Headless and muted: it reads the DOM and nothing else.
