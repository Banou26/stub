// Episode rows carry the release date the sources supply, and a date-only one names the same day
// everywhere.
//
// The sources give TWO shapes and they must be treated differently, which is the whole point:
//
//   an INSTANT   `2026-07-03T15:00:00.000Z`, anizip's `airDateUtc`, 389 of the 439 dates in
//                dist-seed/snapshots.jsonl. A moment in time, so the day it falls on is genuinely
//                July 4 in Tokyo and July 3 in Los Angeles, and rendering it in the viewer's own zone
//                is the correct answer rather than a bug.
//   a NAMED DAY  `2026-08-28`, anizip's `airdate` where no UTC instant is known, the other 50. It
//                names a day and nothing else, so it has to read as that day in every zone. Parsed
//                naively it is midnight UTC, which renders as August 27 west of Greenwich.
//
// The page tells the two apart in its own markup: `releaseDateAttribute` puts the bare day in
// `datetime` for a named day and a full ISO instant for the other, so this reads the attribute to
// decide what to demand of each row.
//
// THE CONTROL is the instants. They MUST disagree across the two zones, which proves this rig can see
// a cross-zone difference at all; without it, a page that rendered nothing, or two contexts that
// silently shared a timezone, would report the named days as agreeing and pass. A run that finds no
// named day at all is INCONCLUSIVE (exit 2), not green.
//
//   npm run dev            # serves on 4560
//   node scripts/check-episode-dates.mjs

// Run it from INSIDE the repo: an ESM script resolves bare specifiers against its own location.
