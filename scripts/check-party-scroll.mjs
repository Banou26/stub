// A follower GLIDES to where the host scrolled, rather than jumping there.
//
// The only honest way to see a glide is to watch for the positions in between: a jump moves once and
// stops, an animation passes through. So this samples the follower's scroll position every frame
// while it follows, and counts the distinct positions strictly between where it started and where it
// ended up.
//
// THE CONTROL IS A SECOND FOLLOWER in the same party, in a context emulating
// `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. It receives the identical message over the identical code path
// and must show essentially none: one or two is a SECOND MESSAGE, not an animation, since a page that
// reflows under the host sends its new position and the follower jumps again. Without the control a
// rig that samples too slowly, or a page that happens to reflow, would report a glide from a jump and
// there would be no way to tell.
//
// Every control also has to be shown to have MOVED. A follower that received nothing at all shows no
// in-between positions either, and would otherwise pass as a well-behaved jump.
