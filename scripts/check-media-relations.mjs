// A media modal shows the works it is related to, with the relation named and the right way round.
//
// The whole path only exists end to end: AniList names the edges, the store flattens and merges them
// across a cluster, and the modal draws them. None of that is reachable from a unit test, and the one
// failure it is really guarding against is silent. `relationType` defaults to AniList's VERSION 1
// vocabulary, which collapses SOURCE into ADAPTATION, so a query missing `(version: 2)` labels the
// novel a show was adapted FROM as something the show is an adaptation OF. Every card still renders.
//
// THE CONTROLS, because "some cards appeared" proves very little:
//
//   - a relation must be one the schema declares, not the raw enum spelling and not the catch-all,
//     since unknown values are deliberately carried as "Related" and would otherwise pass as wording;
//   - a card must link somewhere OTHER than the page it is on, which is what catches a self edge
//     surviving the cluster filter;
//   - the set must contain at least one NON-anime work. A franchise's source novel is the relation a
//     viewer most wants and the one most easily dropped, because `MediaType` cannot spell it and the
//     format has to travel on the edge instead.
//
// A run that finds no media with relations at all is INCONCLUSIVE (exit 2) rather than green: only
// AniList supplies these today, and its public API is off, so the whole row rides the frontend
// fallback in src/sources/anilist/frontend.ts. That being down looks exactly like a page with no
// relations.
