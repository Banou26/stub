/**
 * Threshold calibration for every title matching gate in this repo, measured against the manami
 * anime-offline-database rather than against hand-picked examples.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The matching engine was swapped from seal-wasm to frizbee in b8ee54c. frizbee
 * scores containment-shaped pairs LOWER than seal did, and only one of the thresholds riding that
 * scale was migrated (TITLE_MATCH_THRESHOLD in src/sources/utils.ts, 0.5 to 0.44). The rest still
 * hold numbers calibrated against the old engine. A number that was measured once and then had the
 * ground move under it is worse than no number, because it still reads as measured.
 *
 * HOW TO RUN IT. It is deliberately NOT in vitest.config.ts's include list, which covers src/worker,
 * src/sources and src/utils only, so `npm run test:unit` does not pay for it:
 *
 *   ./node_modules/.bin/vitest run --config vitest.calibration.config.ts \
 *     --disableConsoleIntercept --reporter=verbose
 *
 * `--disableConsoleIntercept` is not optional. Without it vitest swallows console output and the run
 * passes while printing nothing, which is a rig that reports success while measuring nothing.
 * `npx vitest` fails on this machine with EBADDEVENGINES; call the binary directly.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSUMES ABOUT ITS OWN CORRECTNESS: nothing. A check that reports absence is first a claim
 * about the check, so the controls assert that the scorer is live (an identical pair reaches 1.0, an
 * unrelated pair stays near 0, sacha's season stripping actually strips), that the sweep SEPARATES
 * the two arms, and that the separation detector itself rejects a deliberately inert scorer.
 *
 * THE CONTROLS ARE CALIBRATED BY MUTATION, not by argument. Each production function this file leans
 * on is mocked to a pass-through in turn and the run must go RED. Ten mutations, and the list is the
 * specification of what the controls have to catch:
 *
 *   titleSimilarity -> 0 / 0.5 / 1     the dead-wasm case and the two constant-scorer cases
 *   bestTitleScore  -> 0 / 1           the franchise scoring path alone
 *   franchiseTitle  -> identity        a sacha that loads and then declines every title
 *   stripTitle      -> identity        the LABELLER, not the scorer: it decides what the arms are
 *   simplifyTitle   -> []              the rung models silently become the no-rung model
 *   profileCluster  -> empty profile   every fuzzy-merge veto refuses everything
 *
 * The last three were added because they PASSED. An earlier version of this file reported 16 of 16
 * green under all three while every number in the report moved, which is the exact failure mode the
 * paragraph above claims to protect against. What a control suite covers is a measurement, and until
 * the mutation is run it is a hope. Re-run the battery after changing anything here.
 *
 * THE COST ASYMMETRY THE WHOLE FILE IS BUILT AROUND. A false positive welds two unrelated shows
 * together permanently: the store's union-find has no unlink, and a merged cluster then goes on to
 * weld a third. A false negative means one streaming source does not show up for one show. So the
 * objective reported here is maximum recall subject to essentially zero false positives on HARD
 * negatives, never best F1. F1 would trade a permanent lie for a recoverable nuisance at par.

 * The fuzzy-merge model, driven through the REAL profileCluster
 *
 * This section used to be four hand-copied mirrors of unexported fuzzy-merge internals, with a header
 * conceding that "a mirror that has fallen behind still scores every pair and still prints a table"
 * and that no control could catch it. It does not have to be that way: `profileCluster` IS exported,
 * and importing `src/worker/store/fuzzy-merge.ts` under this config costs nothing (it reaches
 * `./db` -> `./graph` + `./events`, and no further, so none of the browser-only surface the extractors
 * drag in is on the path). Measured: the module imports and profiles a cluster in ~130ms here.
 *
 * ONE DEPENDENCY TO KNOW ABOUT: `profileCluster` is module-private at 54aedd4 and public only in the
 * working tree, where the re-check-before-linking pass needs it at two call sites. This file is
 * therefore calibrated against the working tree rather than against the last commit, which is the
 * right target (the point is to calibrate what will ship), but the import breaks outright if that
 * export is reverted, and it will break loudly rather than quietly. Nothing else here reaches into
 * fuzzy-merge, so re-privatising it costs exactly this one import.
 *
 * So the year, format, season and identity vetoes below are now the production ones, obtained by
 * profiling a cluster rather than by re-deriving what profiling would have said. What that removed,
 * and it was not cosmetic in either case:
 *
 *   - the season mirror read `parseSeasonNumber` off the two PRIMARY titles only, where production
 *     reads it off EVERY raw title the cluster holds. The mirror's season veto was therefore weaker
 *     than the shipped one, in the direction that lets more hard negatives through.
 *   - the format mirror read manami's `type` alone, where production reads `media.categories` as well
 *     and keeps SPECIAL, OVA and ONA format-neutral. The two agreed here only because the mirror
 *     duplicated the neutrality rule correctly, which is exactly the agreement a copy stops making
 *     the first time production moves.
 *
 * Two copies survive below, `maxPossibleSimilarity` and `differOnlyByTrailingNumber`, because
 * fuzzy-merge exports neither. Both are covered: the bound-violation scan at the bottom of this file
 * is a live drift detector for the first (it asserts the scan can produce a non-zero count, so a
 * count of zero at the shipped threshold is readable), and the anchors block pins the second to the
 * two pairs fuzzy-merge.ts's own comment measures.

 * catalogues model one show entity per franchise and the extractor resolves the season on a separate
 * axis afterwards, so linking show-level to our season-level media is the intended behaviour. The
 * identical pair is a HARD NEGATIVE at fuzzy-merge, where both sides are OUR OWN season-level

 *
 * manami's `related` does not distinguish "another season of this show" from "a spin-off", so the

 * the crunchyroll gate runs, and labelling ground truth with the thing under test measures the test
 * against itself. So the split is made lexically here, with SEASON_MARKER, which is a plain regex
 * list in src/sources/season.ts with no dependency on sacha or on frizbee.

   *   `SAME YEAR` and `SAME QUARTER` gates model this, because they compare our record's date against
   *   the ONE record on the other side.
   *
   *   SEASON-LEVEL. Ask whether ANY season of the show carries our year. justwatch's NODE_QUERY already
   *   requests `seasons { content { originalReleaseYear } }` at extractor.ts:174 and the details call is
   *   already made at extractor.ts:416 BEFORE the gate, so this costs no extra request; only the
   *   `JWSeason` interface at extractor.ts:249 omits the field, so the data arrives and TypeScript drops
   *   it. appletv reaches the same thing through `AppleEpisode.releaseDate`, which `fetchEpisodes`
   *   already pulls per season.
   *
   * These two fields model the season-level check. The set is the right-hand record plus every record
   * manami relates to it that `relationOf` calls same-show, which is the closest this corpus gets to
   * "the seasons a catalogue would file under one show". A correct match then always contains our own
   * year, so the season-level check costs recall only on records manami never dated, while a wrong

 * crunchyroll ships (extractor.ts:302) CANNOT be measured on this corpus, and any row claiming to be
 * one would be a quarter row wearing a different label.
 *
 * What is measurable is a ladder of buckets, and one rung of it is a genuine BOUND rather than an
 * approximation:
 *
 *   SAME YEAR          365 days wide, and the coarsest thing justwatch's originalReleaseYear can
 *                      support. This is not an approximation of anything, it IS justwatch's axis.
 *   YEAR +/- 1         two years wide. Modelled because a show premiering in late December sits in a
 *                      different calendar year from the catalogue's release year for it, and an exact
 *                      year match refuses that correct pair for a rounding reason.
 *   SAME QUARTER       ~91 days. Neither a lower nor an upper bound on a 45-day window: two dates 30
 *                      days apart straddling New Year are in different quarters, and two dates in one
 *                      quarter can be 89 days apart. Reported because it is the closest single bucket.
 *   ADJACENT QUARTER   ~182 days, and a STRICT SUPERSET of "within 45 days": two dates 45 days apart
 *                      are necessarily in the same or neighbouring quarter, so every pair a 45-day
 *                      window admits is admitted here too. Its hard-negative pass rate is therefore an
 *                      upper bound on the 45-day window's, which is the direction a safety claim needs,
 *                      and its recall is an upper bound too, which is the direction a recall claim must
 *                      NOT be read in.
 *
 * MISSING IS A REFUSAL, never a guess, which is the rule crunchyroll's own header states at
 * extractor.ts:296-299. A null year or an UNDEFINED season on either side fails every predicate here.
 * That costs recall on records manami never dated, and the diagnostics block below reports that cost
 * separately so it is not misread as the date logic being strict.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THIS MODEL FLATTERS, stated here because no number below repeats it. Both sides of a
 * SYNONYM pair are two names off ONE manami record, so they carry one year and one season between
 * them and no date predicate can ever refuse a synonym positive. Production has no such guarantee:
 * our media's startDate comes from AniList and the catalogue's year comes from the catalogue, and they
 * disagree for regional releases and for December premieres. So the date axis's recall cost is
 * measurable here ONLY on the related-same-show arm, where it is real and large, and every aggregate
 * recall number in a date-vetoed row is an OVERSTATEMENT by exactly the amount the synonym arm gets
 * for free.

 * The separation detector, and then the proof that it can fail.
 *
 * A sweep whose arms have the same pass rate at every threshold is not a calibration, it is a scorer
 * that ignores its inputs printing a plausible table. So the detector is written as a standalone
 * function and then run against three deliberately inert scorers, which it MUST reject. Without that
 * second half the detector is itself unverified, and an unverified detector reports success
 * unconditionally.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS A CLAIM ABOUT, and this distinction cost a run to learn. The first version asserted that
 * positives outscore HARD negatives at every gate, and the unogs gate failed it with a margin of
 * 0.1546. That was not a broken harness: it is the finding, that the simplify loop drives the left
 * side onto a parent title so a child entry scores 1.000 against its parent's catalogue name, and no
 * threshold refuses it. An assertion that cannot tell "my rig is dead" from "this gate is weak"
 * converts a result into a failure and hides it.
 *
 * So the assertion is made on the axis where a LIVE scorer cannot fail: positives against EASY
 * negatives, two randomly paired shows. Any scorer that reads its inputs separates those by a mile,
 * and every inert scorer separates them by nothing. The hard-negative margin is then reported as
 * DATA, per gate, because it is the thing being measured.

   * Whether the anchor that PINS 0.44 is a correct match at the call site it pins.

   * The three anchors in utils.ts's comment are all (short title, longer catalogue title), and the
   * comment reads the third, "One Piece" vs "One Piece Film: Red" at 0.447, as "the binding one and it
   * is a correct match". Binding it certainly is: 0.44 is exactly the largest two-decimal value that
   * admits 0.447. Whether it is a correct match depends on which side our media is, and the two
   * readings do not agree:
   *
   *   SAME WORK, different catalogue naming. "Kimetsu no Yaiba" and "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba"
   *   are one show under two catalogues' names, so our media carries the short one and the query is
   *   that string at rung 0. Correct match, genuinely binding from above, nothing more to check.
   *
   *   DIFFERENT WORKS in one franchise. The One Piece series and One Piece Film: Red are two manami
   *   records. The pair is a correct match only when our media is the FILM, and then our media's title
   *   is "One Piece Film: Red" and the query is a rung of THAT, so the question is whether the loop
   *   derives "One Piece" from it. It does not: the rungs are ["One Piece Film: Red", "One Piece Film"].
   *   The pair can therefore only arise with our media being the SERIES and the catalogue having
   *   returned the film, which is the wrong-link case, and the category veto three lines above the
   *   threshold is what refuses it.
   *
   * Both halves are properties of pure functions on fixed strings, so they are checkable rather than
   * arguable. Cowboy Bebop is printed alongside as the contrast: same shape, and the loop DOES reach
   * it, so that anchor survives the objection the One Piece one does not.

  /**
   * TWO INSTRUMENTS THE SATURATION RULE NEEDS BESIDE IT, because on this corpus it degenerates.
   *
   * `saturation` is "the lowest threshold at which the hard-negative rate has come down to its
   * irreducible floor". That is the right rule at a gate whose arms separate: the rate falls, flattens,
   * and the flattening point is the answer. At the 0.44/0.5 family the rate never flattens. It falls
   * smoothly from 62% at 0.30 to 7.9% at 0.70 and keeps falling, so the rule keeps raising and lands at
   * 0.96, where the sweep says it would refuse 8675 hard negatives at a cost of 9945 positives. That is
   * a losing trade reported as a recommendation, and it is the exact shape of a rule that returns an
   * answer whether or not the question has one.
   *
   * So two more instruments, both reported per gate:
   *
   * BUDGET LADDER: the lowest threshold reaching a given absolute hard-negative pass rate, and the
   * recall it buys there. This is the task's criterion stated literally, and its most useful output is
   * NOT a number: it is that several of these gates never reach a small budget at all, which is a fact
   * about the gate rather than about the threshold.
   *
   * EXCHANGE RATE: per 0.01 step, hard negatives refused divided by positives lost. This is the number
   * the cost asymmetry actually acts on. A false positive is a permanent weld and a false negative is
   * one missing streaming row, so a step that refuses more wrong links than it loses correct ones is
   * worth taking and a step below 1.0 is not, whatever the absolute rates are. It also cannot be gamed
   * by an arm's size, because it is a ratio of two deltas measured on the same step.

  /**
   * QUESTION 4: appletv returns the FIRST candidate over the line, not the best one.
   *
   * appletv/extractor.ts:136-142 loops the search results and returns on the first that clears 0.5, so
   * a weak early hit wins over a strong later one. unogs already takes the best (utils.ts:311) and
   * crunchyroll sorts by score before spending a request (extractor.ts:337). This block measures what
   * the difference is worth.
   *
   * THE CANDIDATE SET is built from the corpus rather than from a live search, and that is the model's
   * weakest joint, so it is stated rather than buried. For one media (one manami record) the candidates
   * a search could plausibly return are: the names the record itself is known by (positives), and the
   * franchise siblings manami links it to (hard negatives). Random unrelated records are excluded,
   * because a catalogue search for "Attack on Titan" does not return "Yuru Camp" and counting it as a
   * candidate would make every policy look good.
   *
   * THE ORDER IS UNKNOWN, and that is the honest limit. appletv's shelves are ranked by apple's own
   * relevance, which this corpus cannot reproduce. So FIRST is reported as a uniform draw among the
   * passing candidates, which is the neutral assumption, and the two extremes are printed beside it:
   * if apple always ranks the correct entry first, FIRST never errs on a contested set; if it always
   * ranks it last, FIRST errs on every contested set. BEST is not an assumption at all: it is a
   * measured argmax, and it is the only one of the three that does not depend on the ordering.
