/**
 * The corpus adapter for the GRAPH store, `src/worker/graph`: the ingest of section 4 and the
 * plugins of section 5, driven through the same seven methods `current-store.ts` answers.
 *
 * It is the acceptance harness for the redesign. The cases are the record's hand-decided answers and
 * neither store gets to change them, so a case that passes here and fails there, or the reverse, is
 * the difference between the two implementations stated in the record's own terms.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES WITH A CASE. A corpus row is store-shaped, and this store has no store-shaped door: the
 * only way in is an `Answer` (4.1). So each row becomes one media answer carrying its own claims as
 * `handles`, each episode becomes one episode answer, and `ingestAnswers` decomposes them exactly as
 * a live page does. Nothing here writes a source table directly, which is what keeps the adapter from
 * proving a shape the app can never produce.
 *
 * RESET IS A TRUNCATION, NOT A REOPEN, and that is measured rather than assumed: on
 * `@ladybugdb/wasm-core` 0.20.4 under node, `closeGraph()` resolves and the `openGraph()` after it
 * NEVER settles (2026-09-12, a 20 s test timeout with the close logged and the open still pending),
 * so an engine is one per process and a case that wanted a fresh database would hang the run. `DETACH
 * DELETE` over the eleven node tables empties every table, the rel tables hanging off them included,
 * and leaves the schema in place: 9 ms on a case-sized graph, and 245 ms on the first call of a
 * process, which is the engine still warming up rather than the delete.
 *
 * AN ANSWER IS DEDUPED ON ITS KEY BEFORE THE INGEST SEES IT, because the ingest has no dedupe of its
 * own: `answers.ts` does it in the flush window, and a batch reaching `ingestAnswers` with the same
 * answer twice dies with "Found duplicated primary key value" and takes every other answer in the
 * batch with it (measured 2026-09-12 on `the-live-mushoku-s1-s3-weld`, which states `cr:G24H1N3MP`
 * four times). Any caller that bypasses the log owes the same dedupe.
 *
 * THE PLUGIN STATE IS RESET WITH IT. `runPlugins` keeps each plugin's last output in the module
 * (`resetPassState`), and `plugin:aggregate` carries its cluster ids from exactly that (5.4 P5), so a
 * case that reused it would inherit the previous case's ids and aliases.
