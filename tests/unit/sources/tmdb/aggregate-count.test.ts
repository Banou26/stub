// An aggregated media ALWAYS carries `episodes: []` (aggregateMedia fills that field from a separate
// resolver), so `media.episodeCount ?? media.episodes?.length` read a cluster that declares no count
// as a run of ZERO episodes. Zero is a count, not an absence: read as one it places a run on whatever
// season happens to fit it (docs/design-inputs/01-edge-cases.md case 23).
//
// TMDB's own hint is falsy for both readings of an EMPTY list, so an empty one cannot tell them apart
// here, and the test below hands a NON-EMPTY list instead: the rule is that no list on an aggregated
// media is ever read as its count, and a list that would be read is the only way to show it is not.
