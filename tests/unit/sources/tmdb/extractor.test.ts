// run that IS the second cour numbers its episodes 1 to 12 against TMDB's 13 to 24. The day is what
// pairs those rows; the position cannot.
//
// Mutations, one per test: drop `releaseDate` from `normalizeEpisode`; narrow the `\s+` in
// `parseCardDate` to one literal space; return `text` on a regex miss, or drop the calendar
// round-trip; `continue` on a card with no date span.
