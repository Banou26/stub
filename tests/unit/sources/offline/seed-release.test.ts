// quiet window in the first gap between two sources answering. It exported a median identity of ONE
// and a streaming share of 0.042, and the gate refused it on both. Three independent measurements

// a page and reproduces reliably, scripts/check-similar-media.mjs saw crunchyroll answer between
// 3.0 s and 9.4 s after navigation and needed a 15 s header window, and a 25 s probe of the home page
// read 231 clusters where this walk's 5.3 s read 197. So the floor is the number that decides whether
// a seed is worth publishing at all, and it is pinned here against the walk that measured it.
