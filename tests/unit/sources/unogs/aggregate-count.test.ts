// An aggregated media ALWAYS carries `episodes: []` (aggregateMedia fills that field from a separate
// resolver), so `media.episodeCount ?? media.episodes?.length` read a cluster that declares no count
// as a run of ZERO episodes. Zero is a count, not an absence: `foldVetoed` then refuses every
// candidate season longer than it, which is all of them, and the refusal looks exactly like "this
// source has nothing" (docs/design-inputs/01-edge-cases.md case 23).
//
// This source reads the cluster's count twice, and the first read is a GATE: `matchNetflixSeason`
// waits for a count before asking anything, because unOGS publishes no date at any level and a count
// is the axis it has. So an empty aggregate list cannot tell the two readings apart here, and the
// test below hands a NON-EMPTY one instead: the rule is that no list on an aggregated media is ever
// read as its count, and a list that would be read is the only way to show it is not.
