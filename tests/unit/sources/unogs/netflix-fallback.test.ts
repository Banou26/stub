// unOGS stays the primary Netflix path. This file pins the fallback that runs when it cannot answer:
// Netflix's own endpoint, the one www.netflix.com's public title pages call.
//
// Two things about that endpoint make a test the only way to keep it honest. It caps a season at TEN
// episodes and takes no pagination variable, so a 24 episode season arrives as a PREFIX, and a prefix
// published as a count is evidence the season picker acts on. And its persisted query id is Netflix's,
// hardcoded here, so the day Netflix edits the query every call is answered PersistedQueryNotFound,
// which must arrive as a named failure rather than as a title with no seasons.
