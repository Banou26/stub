// Netflix's own season endpoint is where this source's EPISODES come from: the operation
// www.netflix.com's preview modal calls for one season's episode list. unOGS stays the season INDEX
// (it pages nothing, it answers every season of a title in one request, and it is the only one of the
// two that can search), and it stays the fallback for the episodes themselves.
//
// Four things about that endpoint would each silently cost a whole season, and each has a test below.
// It answers 200 with PARTIAL `UNAUTHENTICATED` errors on every logged-out call, so the natural
// "errors.length means failure" throws all 24 episodes away. Its pagination variable is `cursor` and
// an unknown variable is ignored in SILENCE, so a loop written against `after` reads page one forever.
// Its artwork is not always an episode frame. And its persisted query id is Netflix's, hardcoded, so
// the day they edit it every call must fail loudly rather than as a season with no episodes.
