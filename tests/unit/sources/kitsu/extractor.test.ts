// Kitsu publishes a streaming link on every one of a show's season records, and it is always the
// SHOW's url. Measured 2026-08-31 off /anime/<id>/streaming-links: the identical
// `https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G24H1N3MP/mushoku-tensei-jobless-reincarnation` sits on
// kitsu:45950 (season 2), kitsu:47694 (season 2 part 2) and kitsu:49002 (season 3).
//
// Minting `cr:G24H1N3MP` off that welds all three permanently. Dropping it loses a real offer. This
// file pins the third path: the show goes out as PART_OF, a container edge the store never unions on,
// and the WORKER asks the owning origin for the precise run on the run's own page, with the whole
// cluster's evidence (worker/similar-consumer.ts). Nothing here asks, and nothing here claims.
