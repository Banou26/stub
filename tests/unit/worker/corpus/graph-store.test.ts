/**
 * The corpus against the GRAPH store, at step 2g-c: ALL SIX plugins of 5.4, which is the pass the
 * live worker runs (`DEFAULT_PLUGINS`, imported rather than retyped).
 *
 * IT REPORTS AND IT TRIAGES. Every line the run produces is collected, counted by kind and written to
 * ./graph-store.report.md with a VERDICT against it, and a line with no verdict fails the run. Four
 * verdicts, and only the first is work for this repo's code:
 *
 * - `STORE BUG`: a plugin's rule reached the wrong answer on evidence that was there. Named with the
 *   plugin, the rule, the rows and the fix expected, because that list is what gets dispatched.
 * - `LABEL DOUBTED`: the store is right and the case is not. It goes to the review queue through the
 *   label server, never edited here, and the case stays exactly as labelled until a person settles it.
 * - `RECORDING`: the answer set cannot carry the label. The evidence a rule would need is not in the
 *   rows, so no rule can reach the conclusion; listed in ../../../corpus/known-disagreements.graph.json
 *   with what is missing.
 * - `EXPECTED GAP`: the specification defers the rule and no plugin owes it yet. Named with the section.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED, which is what the steps through 2g promised:
 * - no `WELD` between two rows the labels put apart where BOTH rows carry a first-party id. Sameness
 *   between two metadata catalogues is decided by `plugin:direct` and the guards of 5.2, so a weld
 *   there is a bug in the guards or in the closure of 3.5.
 * - every `together` group that first-party `SAME_AS` claims already join IS together, unless a guard
 *   of 5.2 refused a link inside it and said so on the row.
 * - every `partOf` the labels state that a SOURCE CLAIMED is attached, which is `plugin:direct`'s edge
 *   and `plugin:containment`'s attachment.
 * - EVERY LINE CARRIES A VERDICT, and every verdict matches at least one line. A line nothing triages
 *   is a new disagreement; a rule nothing matches is a disagreement that went away and a stale entry.
 * - the cases the triage calls `RECORDING` are EXACTLY the known-disagreements list, so a fix, a
 *   regression and a stale entry are all loud, which is the contract `current-store.test.ts` holds
 *   its own list to.
 *
 * Nothing here weakens a case to make it pass. A line in the report is a debt, named and owned.
