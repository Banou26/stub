/**
 * The trace of section 7.5, against a real engine seeded through the real ingest and a real pass.
 *
 * WHAT EACH GROUP IS FOR. A trace panel has one job and two ways to fail at it silently. It can
 * answer "nothing" to four different facts, which sends every reader to read the ingest; and it can
 * quietly drop the rows that carry the answer, which are the REFUSED ones, since the question a bug
 * report asks is almost always "why is this NOT here". So the four reasons are asserted apart from
 * each other, a refused link is asserted as a ROW, and `supports` is compared against the columns it
 * was read from rather than merely being non-empty.
 *
 * Group (g) is the four a LIVE page found and none of the groups above could: an ask matched by
 * string equality against an address the app never writes, a uri drawn as both a member and a
 * placeholder, a fill whose descent names a table the bundle did not carry, and an address spanning
 * two clusters. Each one had the panel stating the opposite of the graph it was reading.
 *
 * The read-only group is the one the panel's whole claim rests on: reading the graph must not move it.
 * It is proven the way 5.3's isolation layer is, by intercepting the engine handle rather than by
 * trusting the facade, plus a witness over every table before and after.
 *
 * Every case names the mutation that reddens it.
