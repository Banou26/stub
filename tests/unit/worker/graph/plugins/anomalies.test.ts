/**
 * The anomaly rules of 5.5 and the four invariant queries of 3.5, each with the control 5.5 demands:
 * "every rule ships with a control fixture that must report zero, so a rule that cannot fire in its
 * failure state is caught by its own test".
 *
 * The invariant queries get the same treatment for a harder reason. Three of the four read
 * `MEMBER_OF`, which `plugin:aggregate` writes and which does not exist yet, so all four return 0
 * today whatever the graph holds. A check that reports zero because its table is empty has told you
 * nothing, so each of them is FIRED here by writing the membership by hand through the writer: the
 * positive is what makes the zero elsewhere worth reading.
