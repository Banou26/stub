/**
 * The nine guards of 5.2, one case each, every one of them with its CONTROL: the pair that differs
 * in exactly the fact the guard reads and passes.
 *
 * A guard is a rule about what NOT to write, so a suite without controls would report the same green
 * as one that refused everything. Each case therefore asserts three things: the proposal was refused
 * with the right reason, the downgrade the refusal owes was written in the right DIRECTION, and the
 * control pair became an active link.
 *
 * Against the REAL engine and through the REAL writer, because a verdict that never reaches a row is
 * half the rule: the refusal is a `LINK` row with a status, and the downgrade is a second row of
 * another kind, and both of those are statements the binder either takes or refuses.
