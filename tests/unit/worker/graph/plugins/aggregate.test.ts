/**
 * `plugin:aggregate` of 5.4 P5: membership, the carried ids, the run length, the slots and the JSON a
 * read looks up.
 *
 * WHAT EACH CASE IS FOR. The plugin's whole job is to turn edges into one materialized answer, so the
 * cases are the five things that answer promises: the closure is the membership (3.5), an id is
 * minted once and carried, the length is a vote with classes before tiers, a slot holds one broadcast
 * episode of THIS run, and every field of the view names the member it came from.
 *
 * Two of the rules are tested twice, as pure functions and through the graph. `carryIds` and
 * `trimsRow` decide what nothing in the graph can show once they have decided it: a cluster that kept
 * its id looks exactly like one that was minted with that id, and a trimmed row looks exactly like a
 * row that was never there. The pure case names the rule and the graph case proves it is wired.
