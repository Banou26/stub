/**
 * `plugin:range` of 5.4 P4: the episode pairs that place a play button, and the ranges of 3.4.
 *
 * WHAT EACH CASE IS FOR. The plugin has exactly two ways to be wrong and both are expensive, so the
 * cases are built around them. It can mint a pair that is NOT the same broadcast, which puts a
 * playable url on the wrong row (the title-vote offset put 13 of 25 Blue Exorcist rows wrong,
 * 2026-09-10); or it can refuse a pair it could have proven, which costs a run its buttons silently.
 * So every walkthrough of section 8 is here with its own numbers, each refusal is a case of its own,
 * and the rule that mints nothing at all (Netflix) is asserted as hard as the ones that mint.
 *
 * Every case names the mutation that reddens it. A rule whose whole output is "nothing was proven" is
 * the kind that passes while doing nothing, and three of the cases below assert exactly that.
