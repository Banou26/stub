/**
 * The scoped pass of 5.3: where a plugin's subjects come from, who is skipped, what `ctx.previous`
 * holds under a partial scope, and the one case that decides whether any of it is safe.
 *
 * THE EQUIVALENCE CASE IS THE POINT OF THE FILE. Everything above it checks a mechanism; the last
 * case checks the only property that matters, which is that a graph built by a stream of scoped
 * passes is the graph one full pass would have built. It is written as a DIFF of two exports rather
 * than as a list of expectations, because a hand-written expectation can only pin what was thought
 * of, and the failure being guarded against is a link, an attachment or a slot nobody thought of.
 *
 * Cluster ids are deliberately NOT compared: two arms mint them in different orders and a stable id
 * is a property of one graph over time, not of two graphs against each other. A cluster is keyed by
 * its sorted members, which is what a reader actually resolves through.
