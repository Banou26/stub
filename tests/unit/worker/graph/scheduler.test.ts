/**
 * The scheduler of 5.3: one pass per wake, one wake pending behind the pass in flight, the
 * `view:changed` a pass ends in, and the audit cadence.
 *
 * WHAT EACH CASE IS FOR. Every promise this file makes is about something that did NOT happen: a
 * second pass that did not start, a queue that did not form, an event that was not published. That
 * class of assertion passes while doing nothing more easily than any other, so each case names the
 * mutation that reddens it and most of them carry a control in the same test: the pass that DID run,
 * the membership the event is checked against, the pass that did apply something.
 *
 * The timings are real rather than faked. A pass is a chain of awaits on one engine lane, and a fake
 * clock would let the test decide an ordering the scheduler is supposed to decide, which is the one
 * thing being measured here.
