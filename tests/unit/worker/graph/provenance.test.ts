 * `CLAIMS.provenance`, the column 3.2 puts on the claim edge and 3.3 gives its four values.

 * The one under test here is `address`: a handle rebuilt from the asked uri by `buildHandlesFromUri`
 * names WHICH sources to ask and asserts nothing about how their rows relate (the owner's decision,
 * 2026-09-12). It reaches the ingest two ways, and both are cases below: the handle's own stamp, and
 * the derivation for a claim carrying none, which is every recorded answer and every remote plugin
 * source that never learns to send one.
 *
 * Against the REAL engine, like every other graph suite, because a claim is a column in a statement
 * the binder either takes or refuses. The last case replays the recorded page and reports the table.
