/**
 * The read path of section 6, against a real engine seeded through the real ingest and one real pass.
 *
 * WHAT EACH GROUP IS FOR. The read has exactly three ways to be wrong and all three are silent. It
 * can draw a card that should be hidden, or hide one that should be drawn, which is a page that is
 * subtly the wrong shape; it can answer a payload the SCHEMA then nulls, which takes the whole page
 * down for one missing field; or it can wake on the wrong event, which is a page that never updates
 * and reads as a slow source. So the closed set is executed through a real yoga against the real
 * generated schema with the CLIENT'S OWN DOCUMENTS, read out of the client files rather than retyped,
 * and every wake rule is asserted with the control that must NOT wake beside it.
 *
 * Every case names the mutation that reddens it.
