// tell them apart from the payload. What it decides is WHICH COUNTRY the answer is about, and that
// only shows up as an upstream quietly answering about somebody else's catalogue. Measured
// 2026-09-13 on one page, both paths, same minute: through the relay (Hong Kong) Netflix answered
// Mushoku Tensei `isAvailable: false` with 0 seasons and season 82941638 with 0 episodes; from the
// browser (Tokyo) the same asks answered `isAvailable: true`, 3 seasons and 12 episodes. A control
// title available in both countries came back byte for byte identical over either path, which is what
// rules out the relay mangling anything.
//
// So the two cases that matter are "this host goes direct" and "everything else does not", and a rule
// that sent everything one way would satisfy neither.
