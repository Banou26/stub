 * The three browser APIs linkedom does not implement, which any LAID OUT component needs.
 *
 * linkedom is a DOM without a layout engine, so it has no box model: nothing measures, nothing
 * observes a resize, and no element has a position. A component that only reads and writes nodes
 * never notices. A component that MEASURES itself dies, and `@xyflow/react` is the first one here
 * that does: it dies at `new ResizeObserver` before a single assertion runs.
 *
 * These are stubs and they are deliberately CONSTANT rather than clever. A fake box model that
 * returned plausible varying numbers would let a test assert a position, and that assertion would be
 * about this file rather than about the component. So every element reports the same box, the
 * observer fires once with it, and the honest consequence is that pixel geometry is not testable
 * here: what IS testable is which nodes and edges got rendered and what they carry, which is what the
 * trace panel's cases actually ask.
