// What the media route opens, and on what. Open problem 22, recorded 2026-08-31: "A direct
// navigation to a wide media uri never opens the modal ... The modal matches against the home
// listing's own narrower uri", which is why a pasted media link looked broken.
//
// MEASURED AGAIN 2026-09-12 against the running app (npm run dev, headless Chrome, the real store),
// four direct navigations: a 9 member uri wider than anything the store holds, the record's own
// `ag:(anilist:178789,...)` link, a work the current season listing does not carry at all
// (`ag:(mal:1)`, Cowboy Bebop) and a bare `anilist:178789`. Every one of them mounted the overlay
// and filled it, so the overlay half of that report is closed.
//
// What was left is the match against the listing, which refused every uri that is not an `ag:(...)`
// of its own, so the modal had nothing to draw while the store was still asking. Same day, same rig,
// the first painted frame after a navigation with the season listing already loaded:
//
//   route uri                      | matched by equality of aggregates | matched by shared member
//   /media/anilist:178789          | (empty modal)                     | Mushoku Tensei ... Season 3
//   /media/mal:59193               | (empty modal)                     | Mushoku Tensei ... Season 3
//   /media/ag:(...,zz:99) (wider)  | Mushoku Tensei ... Season 3       | Mushoku Tensei ... Season 3
//   /media/ag:(mal:1) (not listed) | (empty modal)                     | (empty modal)
//
// The third row is the control: it is the same under both rules, so a rig that painted a title
// whatever the code said would have shown the first two filled as well. The fourth is the answer
// staying honest, since nothing on that page names Cowboy Bebop; the store fills it a beat later.
//
// The rule is tested through `src/router/home/modal-media.ts` because media-modal.tsx cannot be
// imported here at all: it reaches @floating-ui/react, which resolves `react` through vite's preact
// alias, and vitest.config.ts carries no plugins, so the import dies with "Cannot find package
// 'react'". The `tests/unit/components/dom.ts` harness does not help, and it was measured rather
// than assumed: importing the modal behind it fails identically, since what is missing is a package
// and not a document. The component's own shape is therefore read off the source below, each
// assertion with a control, the way tests/unit/components/chrome.test.ts reads css it cannot lay out.
