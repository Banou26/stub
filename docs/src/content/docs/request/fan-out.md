title: The fan-out
description: One document, replayed against every registered source at once. There is no origin test anywhere in the join loop, and that is the fact most diagrams of this system get wrong.
---

The first pass asks **every** source. Not the ones whose origin appears in the uri, not the ones that
declare they can answer, not the ones with a key configured. Every registered source, unconditionally,
with the same document and the same variables, in one synchronous loop.

`src/worker/extractor.ts:792`:

```ts
for (const extractor of extractors) joinFanout(fanout, extractor)
```

`joinFanout` (`src/worker/extractor.ts:746-766`) contains exactly one test, and it is not an origin
test: `if (fanout.joined.has(extractor)) return`. Nothing in it reads the uri, `supportedUris`, or
`origin`. A source decides for itself, inside its own `Subscription.media`, whether the question is
about it; that is [self-selection](/request/self-selection/), and it happens 24 times in parallel
inside 24 separate GraphQL servers. Twenty-four is the built-in count, not a round number:
`src/sources/index.ts` exports 24 modules and `tests/unit/sources/index.test.ts:24` pins it with
`expect(names).toHaveLength(24)`.

Open `ag:(anilist:166873)` and Crunchyroll, Netflix, Apple TV, Disney, HBO and eighteen others are all
asked about it. Exactly two are addressable by that uri at all: anilist, whose own origin is named, and
offline, whose `supportedUris` is `['offline', ...INDEXED_ORIGINS]` and so covers `anilist`
(`src/sources/offline/extractor.ts:48`, `src/sources/offline/index-lookup.ts:20`). The other twenty-two
find nothing in it they could recognise and yield `media: null`. That is not waste to be optimised
away: it is the only mechanism by which a source that *does* recognise itself gets to answer, and the
cost of asking a source that refuses is one generator that yields once and ends.

## The answer does not come back this way

Worth saying before the first figure, because the arrows are otherwise misread. The fan-out's return
values are almost entirely discarded. Sources write to the graph store through an envelop
`useOnResolve` hook inside their own yoga (`src/worker/extractor.ts:473-491`), the store emits
`media:changed`, and the app-level resolver re-reads the store and yields the aggregate
(`src/worker/resolvers/media/index.ts:81-87`). The subscription callback the fan-out installs is
`(result) => { if (!fanout.extractUris) return ... }`, and `extractUris` is passed by exactly one
caller in the codebase: `Subscription.mediaPage` (`src/worker/resolvers/media/index.ts:97-107`).

So on the `MEDIA` path every payload from every source is dropped on the floor, and the page still
gets its data. The fan-out is a *trigger*, not a query.

*The dashed arrow is the only one that carries data anywhere useful. `stamp` is the one place a
question can lose its request context without anyone noticing, because it returns the variables
unchanged rather than throwing.*

Three details in that figure decide behaviour downstream.

**`ctx.params.query` is the app's document, not a document the fan-out writes.** `proxyRequestToExtractors`
(`src/worker/extractor.ts:783-791`) copies `ctx.params.query!` and `ctx.params.variables` straight off
the incoming request. Every source's private schema is built from the same generated `typeDefs`
(`src/worker/extractor.ts:416`) as the app's, which is what makes the app's document validate against a
source's server. The consequence belongs on
[from the address bar to the worker](/request/page-to-worker/): the page's selection set is replayed
verbatim at 24 servers, so a field the page did not select is a resolver that never runs at any source.

**`stamp` fails soft.** `src/worker/request-context.ts:136-140`:

```ts
export const stamp = <T extends Record<string, unknown>>(variables: T, context: RequestContext): T => {
  const input = variables.input
  if (input == null || typeof input !== 'object') return variables
  return { ...variables, input: { ...input as object, context } }
}
```

A subscription whose variables carry no `input` object is sent without a context, the source's
`readContext` finds no token, `misses++` (`src/worker/request-context.ts:125`) and it falls through to
`UNKNOWN_POLICY = { crossSource: true }` (`src/worker/request-context.ts:73`). Failing open is
deliberate; the counter is what makes the failure visible. See
[the request context](/request/request-context/).

**`joined` is keyed on the entry, not the origin.** `fanout.joined` is a
`Map<ExtractorEntry, FanoutSubscription>` (`src/worker/extractor.ts:737`), and its comment says what it
is for (`src/worker/extractor.ts:738`):

> stamped onto every joiner, including one that registers mid-flight, so no source is left unstamped

A plugin that connects while a page is open runs `for (const fanout of fanouts) joinFanout(fanout, entry)`
(`src/worker/extractor.ts:689`) against every in-flight fan-out, and joins each one exactly once, with
the **original** variables and the **same** root context. `const fanouts = new Set<Fanout>()`
(`src/worker/extractor.ts:743`) exists for that and says so at `:742`:

> every in-flight fan-out, so a source that registers mid-subscription can still join it

:::danger[The side channel is the irreversible half]
Nothing on this page is undone by unsubscribing. A source's rows reach `upsertMedia` through
`useOnResolve` and the `mediaInserter` DataLoader while the subscription is alive, and `upsertMedia`
resolves a `SAME_AS` claim between two RUN rows into `graph.link`, a union-find union with **no
inverse** (`src/worker/store/db.ts:162-198`). Scalars written by `graph.set` are last-write-wins.
Tearing the fan-out down stops further questions; it does not unweld a cluster a source already
welded. See [upsertMedia](/write/upsert-media/).
:::

## What `makeExtractor` bolts onto every source

A source module is a bag of resolvers. `makeExtractor` (`src/worker/extractor.ts:411-549`) turns it
into a server, and the same wrapper is applied to a built-in and to a plugin
(`src/worker/extractor.ts:681`). Everything a source did not write is in here.

*Every default in this figure is a refusal or an empty-list guard. The one decision a source cannot
override is the shape of a refusal it never wrote.*

**The list guards are not tidiness.** `src/worker/extractor.ts:425-427`:

> every non-null list on Media needs one of these, because a source may omit any field and a null in a
> non-null position nulls its whole parent, taking the rest of the payload with it

**The `similarMedia` default yields its refusal rather than ending**, and the reason is the most
reusable sentence on this page. `src/worker/extractor.ts:459-462`:

> most sources cannot answer show-plus-evidence, and the default has to YIELD that rather than end: a
> subscription generator that completes without yielding makes yoga respond 204 No Content, which the
> caller would sit on until its timeout instead of reading a refusal off the first payload

That timeout is `SIMILAR_MEDIA_TIMEOUT_MS = 30_000` (`src/worker/extractor.ts:198`). Twenty-two sources
that cannot answer, each held for thirty seconds, is the outcome the yield avoids. The rule is
independently restated inside a source, which is a good sign it is real rather than folklore;
`src/sources/offline/extractor.ts:231-232`:

> Always yield at least once. A subscription generator that completes without yielding makes yoga
> answer 204 No Content, which is not the same thing as "this source knows nothing".

The same 204 rule is what makes the uri gate in `Subscription.media` a hard stop rather than an error:
a `return` with no yield leaves the page on `data === undefined` forever.

**The response cache is inert here, and this is checkable rather than assumed.**
`useResponseCache({ session: () => null, ttl: 15 * 60 * 1000 })` sits at `src/worker/extractor.ts:470`,
so 15 minutes with no session partitioning. The comment at `src/worker/resolvers/media/index.ts:52-53`
says why it never fires on this path:

> nothing caches this path (@envelop/response-cache hooks onExecute and skips subscriptions), so a
> blanket re-fan would re-hit every upstream on every merge

Confirmed against the installed package rather than taken on trust: `@envelop/response-cache/cjs/plugin.js`
defines `onExecute` at line 165 and no `onSubscribe` anywhere, so a subscription operation never reaches
it. The cache is live only for a query or a mutation, and no fan-out issues either. This is the load-bearing
premise of the [re-ask](/request/re-ask/): re-asking newly named origins rather than re-running the whole
fan-out matters precisely because a blanket re-fan would hit every upstream again.

**`maskError` does not mask.** `src/worker/extractor.ts:499-504` logs
`Server Extractor <name> GQLError occurred:` and returns `new GraphQLError((error as Error).message)`,
so the upstream message survives to the client side of that source's own urql client, where
`errorExchange` (`src/worker/extractor.ts:507-523`) logs it a second time under one of two shapes,
`Client Extractor <name> Network error on <operation>` or `... GraphQL error on ...`. It never swallows
and never retries; retrying lives in [`fetchWithBackoff`](/request/fetch-and-backoff/).

**Five functions cross into every resolver.** The object literal at `src/worker/extractor.ts:532-538`
*is* the `ExtractorServerContext` (`src/worker/extractor.ts:34-44`). Two of them are the interesting
ones: `fetch` is `fetchWithBackoff`, never `globalThis.fetch`, so no source can skip the backoff; and
`similarMedia` is `similarMediaFrom(extractor.origin)`, bound to this source as the **caller**, so
`MAX_SIMILAR_MEDIA_PER_CALLER = 8` (`src/worker/extractor.ts:227`) is spent against an origin the
wrapper decided, never one the source declared about itself. Its own comment at
`src/worker/extractor.ts:298` puts it plainly: the ask is *bound to the origin doing the asking so a
budget can be attributed to it*.

*Three try/catch sites, three distinct log lines, and only the first of the three abandons the source.
None of them throws upward, so a broken source is a missing row and never a broken page.*

`src/worker/extractor.ts:745`, the sentence the whole figure exists to state:

> one source must never be able to take down the fan-out: a source that cannot start is skipped

The three sites differ in what survives:

| site | line | on failure |
|---|---|---|
| `joinFanout` around `.subscribe` | `src/worker/extractor.ts:760-763` | logs, `return`. The entry is in neither `joined` nor `subscriptions`, so it is never asked and never torn down. It can still join a *later* fan-out. |
| the payload callback's `extractUris` | `src/worker/extractor.ts:756-758` | logs, the subscription stays alive, later payloads are still read. |
| `askOrigins` around the re-ask | `src/worker/extractor.ts:835-837` | logs, `continue` to the next source in the loop. |

Note what a failed join does **not** do: it does not mark the source as failed. Nothing records it, so
the next page open builds a fresh `Fanout` and asks it again.

:::caution[`extractors` is a mutable module singleton]
`export const extractors = Object.values(extractorDefinitions).map(makeExtractor)`
(`src/worker/extractor.ts:551`) is built once at module load, and plugin registration mutates it in
place: `extractors.push(entry)` at `:683`, `extractors.splice(index, 1)` at `:719`. So "every
registered source" means *every source registered at the instant the loop runs*, and the set can differ
between two fan-outs opened seconds apart. `close()` (`src/worker/extractor.ts:849`) removes the fan-out
from `fanouts` so no further late joiners arrive, and deliberately does not unsubscribe: the caller
still tears down what it holds.
:::

## The two fan-outs that are not this one

`proxyRequestToExtractors` is not the only place `extractors` is looped over and subscribed to.
`Subscription.origin` and `Subscription.originPage` (`src/worker/resolvers/origin/index.ts:21-26` and
`:50-55`) each build their own, by hand, and they are missing four things the real one has.

*Both of these refuse first and fan out second, which is the opposite order to `Subscription.media`,
where the refusal is the only thing standing between an unparseable uri and 24 source servers.*

Four differences, each with a consequence:

- **No `stamp`.** The variables go out exactly as they arrived, so `input.context` is absent, so
  `readContext` returns `undefined` and increments `misses`. Any source that read `policyFor` on this
  path would get `UNKNOWN_POLICY`, which is `{ crossSource: true }` (`src/worker/request-context.ts:73`).
  No built-in reads the policy in its `origin` resolver today, so nothing misbehaves; the counter still
  moves, which is exactly what the counter is for.
- **No `fanouts` entry.** These loops never register themselves, so `registerRemoteExtractor`'s late-join
  loop (`src/worker/extractor.ts:689`) cannot see them. A plugin that connects while an origin
  subscription is open is never asked for its `Origin` row until the next one opens.
- **No `extractUris`.** The subscribe callback is literally `() => {}`. The origin rows land the same
  way media rows do, through `useOnResolve` firing on a field whose named type is `Origin`.
- **No `close()` and no root.** `openRoot`/`closeRoot` are never called here, so there is no rootId to
  clean up, which is consistent: nothing was minted. Teardown is the `finally` block at
  `src/worker/resolvers/origin/index.ts:38-42` and `:67-70`, which unsubscribes everything and then
  yields one last time.

The refusal at `src/worker/resolvers/origin/index.ts:48` is the one that shows up on screen. It is why
`episodeOriginIds` matters on the media modal: an empty id list means `originPage` yields nothing at
all, and a perfectly playable episode renders its row with no source icons.

## What this page does not decide

Two things happen next and belong elsewhere.

- **Whether a source recognises itself in the uri it was handed.** Every source answers that on its own,
  and Crunchyroll's four branches are the canonical shape:
  [how a source recognises itself](/request/self-selection/).
- **What happens when a source is asked too early.** A source whose id is contributed *later* by another
  source was asked before that id existed, refused, and ended: its `Subscription.media` is a yield-once
  generator with no retry. `askOrigins` (`src/worker/extractor.ts:825-839`) is the second half of the
  fan-out and the only place origin matching decides anything: [the re-ask](/request/re-ask/).
