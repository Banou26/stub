title: The request context
description: How a source at the bottom of the call knows whether a person is looking at one media or scrolling a listing, why that fact rides in the GraphQL variables rather than in a header, and the counter that exists because its failure mode is silence.
---

Every source is asked the same question. `media(input: { uri })` arrives at Crunchyroll's yoga, at
JustWatch's, at twenty-two others, and none of them can tell from the arguments whether a person has a
detail page open or whether this is row 14 of a search that will scroll past before anyone reads it.

`src/worker/request-context.ts:3-8`:

> A source is handed `media(input: { uri })` and cannot tell whether a person is looking at that one
> media or whether it is one row of a listing that will never be read. So it does the same work either
> way, and the expensive answer is right in one case and wasted in the other. justwatch's search is
> the live instance: `mediaPage` maps every result through `normalizeMedia`, which reaches
> `buildOffersAsHandles`, which calls into Crunchyroll once per film result to turn a /watch/ url into
> a series id (justwatch/extractor.ts:305). Nothing on a search results page needs that id.

That is the whole of what this module buys. `resolveEpisodeToSeriesId`
(`src/sources/crunchyroll/extractor.ts:133-142`) costs a Crunchyroll access token plus one CMS request
against `/objects/<episodeId>`, and on a search for `frieren` JustWatch runs it once for every film in
the result set. The id it produces identifies a *run*, which is a question only a detail view asks.

The module is deliberately import-free:

`src/worker/request-context.ts:10-12`:

> This module is the registry and the wire format. It deliberately imports NOTHING from the worker or
> the store, so it stays importable under vitest: `worker/extractor.ts` is not, because it imports
> `Client` from urql and through it react.

## The registry, hop by hop

There are two objects in play and they are easy to confuse. A **`RequestContext`** is one hop: a token,
the root it belongs to, the operation the app was asked for, and the origins already on the stack. The
**registry** is a module-level `Map<string, RequestContext>` called `hops`
(`src/worker/request-context.ts:79`), keyed by token, and it is the only authority on any of it.

```mermaid

  Note over REG: every hop with rootId r1 is deleted, t2 and t3 together
  CR->>REG: a late policyFor(input) with token t3
  alt the token still names a live hop
    REG-->>CR: the authoritative record
  else the root was closed, or the token was never minted
    REG-->>CR: undefined, misses++, UNKNOWN_POLICY
  end
```

*Two roots on one page get two `rootId`s and two disjoint sets of tokens, so closing one cannot touch
the other. `closeRoot` and a forged token are the same answer on purpose, and the last exchange is the
one that keeps the site working when the plumbing breaks.*

`openRoot` (`:86-89`) and `descend` (`:92-93`) both funnel into `mint` (`:95-99`), which is the only
writer of the registry:

```ts
const mint = ({ rootId, operation, chain }: Omit<RequestContext, 'token'>): RequestContext => {
  const context: RequestContext = { token: `t${++counter}`, rootId, operation, chain }
  hops.set(context.token, context)
  return context
}
```

One `counter` (`:80`) numbers both, so a root is `r1` and its first token is `t2`. The numbers
interleave and that is fine: a token is an opaque key into `hops`, never a position.

`descend` keeps `rootId` and `operation` and grows `chain` by the calling origin, so a `similarMedia`
hop made by kitsu inherits kitsu's policy rather than deriving one of its own.
`tests/unit/worker/request-context.test.ts:63-72` pins both halves, including that each hop gets its own
token, "which is what varies the urql key".

`closeRoot` (`:111-113`) walks the whole map and deletes every entry whose `rootId` matches. Nothing
else ever removes a hop, so a root that is opened and never closed leaks for the life of the worker.
The app closes exactly one place: `close()` on the object `proxyRequestToExtractors` returns
(`src/worker/extractor.ts:849`), which the `finally` block of both `Subscription.media` and
`Subscription.mediaPage` calls on teardown.

`resetRegistry` (`:149`) exists and must never be called by the app:

`src/worker/request-context.ts:145-147`:

> Empty the registry. TESTS ONLY, and for one reason: it is a module singleton, so a test asserting on
> `registrySize` otherwise reads whatever the tests before it left behind and fails for reasons that
> are not in it. Never called by the app, where dropping live hops would refuse every source in flight.

### Only the token is read off the wire

`readContext` (`:122-127`) reaches past everything the caller sent and asks the registry:

```ts
export const readContext = (input: unknown): RequestContext | undefined => {
  const token = (input as { context?: { token?: unknown } } | null | undefined)?.context?.token
  const context = contextOf(token)
  if (!context) misses++
  return context
}
```

`src/worker/request-context.ts:118-120`:

> REGENERATED FROM THE REGISTRY, never trusted as sent. The only thing taken off the wire is the
> token, so a source or a plugin that rewrites `operation` or `chain` is describing a hop this worker
> already has its own record of.

This is not theoretical. A plugin source runs in another realm and receives its arguments across a
`MessagePort`, so `RequestContext` is a real GraphQL input type
(`src/worker/resolvers/media/schema.gql:403-411`) with `token: ID!`, `rootId: ID!`,
`operation: RootOperation!` and `chain: [String!]!`, all four of which a plugin can rewrite before
answering. Rewriting three of them changes nothing.

`src/worker/resolvers/media/schema.gql:396-401`:

> What the app asked for at the TOP of the call, so a source can tell a detail view from a listing.
>
> THE WORKER WRITES THIS. Every field is regenerated from the worker's own registry at each source's
> boundary before the arguments are coerced, so a value supplied by a caller is replaced rather than
> trusted, and only `token` is ever read off the wire. Nullable because the app's own documents send
> none: they are validated by the app-level server before the fan-out that stamps them runs.

`tests/unit/worker/request-context.test.ts:54-61` is the proof, and it fails loudly if the read is ever
shortened to `input.context.operation`: it opens a `MEDIA_PAGE` root, sends `{ ...root, operation:
'MEDIA' }` on the wire, and asserts `readContext(lying)?.operation` is still `MEDIA_PAGE`.

`contextOf` (`:107-108`) is the whole lookup, and its two failure modes are deliberately one:

`src/worker/request-context.ts:102-105`:

> The authoritative context for a token, or undefined for one this worker never minted.
>
> Undefined is the answer for a forged token AND for a hop whose root has been closed, and the two are
> deliberately the same: neither is a request this worker is still serving.

## Why it rides in the variables

The context is not a header and not urql operation context. Both were tried on this machine and both
are unusable, for reasons that have nothing to do with each other.

*The three refusal nodes are three different shapes of failure. The header throws where you can see it,
the operation context returns the wrong answer silently, and `stamp` returns the variables untouched
and asks the source anyway. Only the third one reaches production, which is why the counter exists.*

`src/worker/request-context.ts:14-24`:

`src/worker/request-context.ts:26-27`:

> So the token below is load bearing twice over. It is the join key into this registry, AND it is a
> variable, which is what stops two roots sharing one context.

`stamp` (`:136-140`) is the writer, and it fails soft:

```ts
export const stamp = <T extends Record<string, unknown>>(variables: T, context: RequestContext): T => {
  const input = variables.input
  if (input == null || typeof input !== 'object') return variables
  return { ...variables, input: { ...input as object, context } }
}
```

Every fan-out subscription goes through it: the first pass at `src/worker/extractor.ts:750`, the re-ask
at `:833`. Both `mediaPage` call sites in the app do carry an `input` object
(`src/router/home/index.tsx:75-91`, `src/router/search/index.tsx:271`), so on those paths the stamp
lands.

The `similarMedia` funnel is the one path that reaches the same result without `stamp`.
`similarOutcomeFrom` writes the descended context onto the input object itself
(`src/worker/extractor.ts:323-324`) and `firstSimilarMedia` then subscribes with `{ input }` (`:271`),
so the context is already inside `input` before the variables are built.

Two paths in the worker never stamp anything. `Subscription.origin` and `Subscription.originPage`
(`src/worker/resolvers/origin/index.ts:21-26` and `:50-55`) build their own fan-out loop and pass
`ctx.params.variables` straight through, unstamped. Every source asked on those two paths reads a miss.

## The policy table, and its two readers

The context carries four fields. Exactly one of them is turned into behaviour, through a table of three
rows:

```ts
const POLICY: Record<RootOperation, RequestPolicy> = {   // src/worker/request-context.ts:59-63
  MEDIA: { crossSource: true },
  MEDIA_PAGE: { crossSource: false },
  SIMILAR_MEDIA: { crossSource: true },
}

export const UNKNOWN_POLICY: RequestPolicy = { crossSource: true }   // :73
```

`src/worker/request-context.ts:52-55`:

> Whether an answer is worth a cross-source request. False on a listing, where the expensive id is
> not read by anything on screen, and true on a detail view, which is what the id is for.

*A miss and a `MEDIA` root take the same edge out of this figure, which is the design. The only branch
the policy actually closes today is the one from `NO`, and everything downstream of `S2A` is permanent.*

Two call sites read `crossSource`, and there are no others in the tree.

**The similarMedia consumer**, `src/worker/similar-consumer.ts:281`:

```ts
if (!policyFor({ context }).crossSource) return
```

It is the first line of `resolveSimilarRuns`, before any evidence is gathered.

`src/worker/similar-consumer.ts:269-277`:

> Ask every owed container origin and claim each answer as SAME_AS of the run. Never throws.
>
> Only a root whose policy spends cross-source work asks (a listing never does). A read with no
> evidence records nothing, and a read whose run has no title asks nothing, since an answer could not
> be checked against the show. The claim goes through `upsertMedia` with no rows: the answer's own
> row lands through the answering extractor's insertion, the claim waits for it under
> `pendingClaims`, and a RUN x RUN union emits `media:changed`, which re-runs the page's read, whose
> re-ask of the newly named origin is how the answer's episodes reach the store. The container edge is
> never touched.

Note the shape of the call: `policyFor({ context })`. The consumer is handed the `RequestContext`
object itself by `src/worker/resolvers/media/index.ts:76`, so it wraps it to look like a resolver's
`input` before reading it. The comment one line above that call site says the guard is belt and braces:
"a MEDIA root by construction: only this resolver runs it, so a listing never asks".

**JustWatch's offer builder**, `src/sources/justwatch/extractor.ts:372`:

```ts
if (!rawContentId && mappedOrigin === 'cr' && url && meta.seasonNumber == null && !meta.showContainer && policy.crossSource) {
```

`src/sources/justwatch/extractor.ts:363-367`:

> THE ONE CROSS-SOURCE CALL ON THIS PATH, and the reason the request context exists. Turning a
> /watch/&lt;episodeId&gt; url into a series id costs a Crunchyroll token plus a CMS request, PER FILM
> RESULT, and `mediaPage` runs this for every hit in a search. Nothing on a results page reads
> that id: it identifies the run, which is a detail-view question. So on a listing the offer keeps
> its url and loses only the identity claim, and the detail view spends the request as before.

The policy is threaded as an ordinary parameter, defaulted at three signatures:
`buildOffersAsHandles` (`:323`), `showAsContainer` (`:431`) and `normalizeMedia` (`:467`) each declare
`policy: RequestPolicy = UNKNOWN_POLICY`. `mediaPage` reads the real one once, at `:766`, and passes it
down through `normalizeMedia`.

:::danger[The claim this policy gates is permanent]
When the branch fires, the resolved series id becomes `sameAs(makeMedia({ origin, id: contentId, url }))`
(`src/sources/justwatch/extractor.ts:399-400`), and a `SAME_AS` handle between two `RUN`-scoped rows is
`graph.link`, a union-find union. **Union-find has no inverse.** Two runs welded into one component stay
welded; there is no unlink, and no later source can split them.

The condition has six conjuncts, not five: `!rawContentId`, `mappedOrigin === 'cr'`, `url`,
`meta.seasonNumber == null`, `!meta.showContainer`, `policy.crossSource`. The fifth is the one that is
there for correctness rather than for cost.

`src/sources/justwatch/extractor.ts:368-371`:

> `meta.showContainer` excludes this branch deliberately. It resolves a /watch/ url to the SEASON
> that episode is in, which is a RUN, and the media being built here is the SHOW: claiming the two
> are the same is a cross-scope weld, and `graph.link` has no inverse. The offer is dropped rather
> than demoted because crunchyroll already reaches this cluster under its own series container.

`policy.crossSource` is the cheap gate on that path and `!meta.showContainer` is the correctness one.
Failing open on the first is a wasted request; failing open on the second is a permanent wrong answer.
:::

## Failing open, and the counter that makes it observable

An absent context has to behave exactly as the code behaved before this module existed. That is not a
concession, it is the requirement:

`src/worker/request-context.ts:66-71`:

> The fallback for a hop that arrived with no context, which must be TODAY'S BEHAVIOUR.
>
> Failing open is the deliberate choice for the policy and it is why `misses` exists next to it. A
> context that stopped arriving would otherwise be indistinguishable from one that is working, since
> every source would simply keep fetching exactly as it does now, with the whole suite green. The
> counter is the observable that tells those two apart, and `request-context.test.ts` asserts it moves.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  direction LR
  state "a hop arrives and calls policyFor(input)" as hop
  state "the registry answered with its own record" as live
  state "no record for that token" as gone
  state "misses++ and contextMisses moves" as counted
  state "crossSource true, the source spends the request" as spends
  state "crossSource false, the claim is skipped" as skips

  [*] --> hop
  hop --> live: the token names a hop this worker minted
  hop --> gone: no token, a forged token, or closeRoot already ran

```

*There is no transition from `gone` to `skips`. A hop that lost its context cannot be told from a
detail view by anything on this diagram, and the only trace it leaves is the counter.*

`tests/unit/worker/request-context.test.ts:1-4`:

> The context has ONE failure mode worth designing against: arriving empty. Every source falls back to
> today's behaviour when it does, with the whole suite green and the site working, so absence is
> indistinguishable from success by construction. `contextMisses` is the observable that separates

The test that carries the weight is the inert one, `:40-44`. It asserts that `policyFor({})` and
`policyFor(undefined)` both equal `UNKNOWN_POLICY`, and then that `contextMisses()` is exactly `2`.
Its own comment: "If this test is deleted, so is the ability to notice."

:::caution[The counter has no runtime reader]
`contextMisses` and `resetContextMisses` (`src/worker/request-context.ts:76-77`) are exported and,
outside `tests/`, called nowhere. Grep the tree: the only readers are
`tests/unit/worker/request-context.test.ts:43` and `:49`. Nothing logs it, no console line reports it,
and no check-script reads it off a deployed worker the way `scripts/check-similar-media.mjs` reads the
`similarMedia:` lines. So the observable exists and is asserted in CI, and a context that stopped
arriving in the *browser* would still be silent. The counter proves the mechanism works; it does not
yet monitor it.
:::

## What the code says that the plan did not

Four things read differently in the tree at `883aec9` than in the notes this page was written from. The
code wins in all four.

**JustWatch's `Subscription.media` never calls `policyFor`.** The plan lists `justwatch/extractor.ts:593`
as a read on the media path. It is not: `:593` sits inside `similarSeason`, which is the
`Subscription.similarMedia` resolver (`:748-753`). The media path is `:755-759` into `resolveMedia`
(`:724-744`), and it calls `normalizeMedia(node, { seasons, seasonNumber }, ctx)` at `:709` and `:736`
and `showAsContainer(node, ctx)` at `:718`, all three **without a policy argument**, so all three take
the `UNKNOWN_POLICY` default. The behaviour is right by coincidence rather than by reading: a `MEDIA`
root's policy is `{ crossSource: true }` and so is `UNKNOWN_POLICY`, so the two are indistinguishable.
No miss is counted on that path either, because nothing there calls `readContext` at all. So the real
count of policy reads in JustWatch is two, at `:593` and `:766`, and only `:766` can ever produce
`false`.

**`SIMILAR_MEDIA` is never opened as a root.** `openRoot` has exactly one call site in `src/`
(`src/worker/extractor.ts:782`, inside `proxyRequestToExtractors`), and its two callers pass `'MEDIA'`
(`src/worker/resolvers/media/index.ts:39`) and `'MEDIA_PAGE'` (`:100`). A `similarMedia` hop does not
open a root: `similarOutcomeFrom` calls `descend(parent, caller)` (`src/worker/extractor.ts:323-324`),
which keeps the parent's `operation`. So a `similarMedia` ask made from a detail view carries
`operation: 'MEDIA'`, and the third row of `POLICY` is reachable today only from
`tests/unit/worker/request-context.test.ts:27`. The row is not dead code so much as a declared
position: it says what the policy would be if the funnel ever became its own root.

**`chain` is written and read by nothing.** `descend` grows it (`:93`), the schema declares it
(`schema.gql:410`), the generated types carry it, and no consumer in `src/` ever inspects it. The cycle
it is documented to make visible is actually handled elsewhere and differently, by joining an in-flight
ask rather than by looking at the stack (`src/worker/extractor.ts:336-350`). It is a field kept honest
for a reader that does not exist yet.

**`justwatch/extractor.ts:305` in the module header has drifted.** That line is now `jwCandidates`. The
call the comment is pointing at is `resolveEpisodeToSeriesId` at `src/sources/justwatch/extractor.ts:375`,
defined at `src/sources/crunchyroll/extractor.ts:133-142`. The claim is still exactly right; only the
line moved.

## The four fields, and what each is worth

| field | written by | read by | what happens if a caller rewrites it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `mint` (`:96`), one per hop | `readContext` (`:123`), the only field taken off the wire | the lookup misses, `misses++`, `UNKNOWN_POLICY` |
| `rootId` | `openRoot` (`:87`), shared by every hop of a call tree | `closeRoot` (`:112`) | nothing: the registry's own copy is what `closeRoot` matches on |
| `operation` | `openRoot`, inherited by `descend` | `policyFor` (`:132`), from the registry record | nothing, and `request-context.test.ts:54-61` pins that |
| `chain` | `descend` (`:93`), nearest caller last | nothing in `src/` | nothing |

`registrySize()` (`:142`) is the fifth observable and, like `contextMisses`, has readers only in tests
(`request-context.test.ts:82-84`). It is what proves `closeRoot` drops a root's hops and leaves an
unrelated root's alone.
