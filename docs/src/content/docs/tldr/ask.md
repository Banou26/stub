title: The ask
description: "How one uri in the address bar becomes 24 concurrent subscriptions, what each source does with one, and why the answers never come back down the path they went out on."
---

One uri becomes 24 concurrent GraphQL subscriptions, one per registered source, each against a private yoga replaying the page's own document. Nothing picks which sources to ask: every source gets the question and decides for itself whether it names them.

## The gate

wouter hands a route segment through undecoded, so every uri passes `decodeRouteUri` (src/utils/uri.ts:162-170) at the router (media-modal.tsx:599, watch/index.tsx:177-182) and again in the worker (src/worker/resolvers/media/index.ts:33). It must then satisfy `isUri(uri) || isAggregatedUri(uri)`; anything else logs `media: refused '<uri>', which names no uri` and returns **without yielding** (:34-37): yoga answers 204 No Content and the page holds `data === undefined` forever, no error anywhere. Inside a source the rule inverts: a refusal is a `yield` of null and never a return (defaults at src/worker/extractor.ts:457-463), or a `similarMedia` generator ending silently would hold its caller for `SIMILAR_MEDIA_TIMEOUT_MS = 30_000` (:198).

| | `Subscription.media` | `Subscription.mediaPage` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| uri gate | `decodeRouteUri` then `isUri \|\| isAggregatedUri` (media/index.ts:33) | none |
| root operation | `MEDIA` (media/index.ts:39) | `MEDIA_PAGE` (media/index.ts:100) |
| reads the fan-out payload | no | yes, via `extractUris` on `mediaPage.nodes` |
| re-ask | `askOrigins` on every newly named origin | none |
| re-read trigger | `media:changed`, `episode:changed` | `media:changed`, debounced 100ms |

## The fan-out

`proxyRequestToExtractors` builds one `Fanout` carrying `ctx.params.query`, the page's literal document, then runs one loop: `for (const extractor of extractors) joinFanout(fanout, extractor)` (worker/extractor.ts:792). `joinFanout` contains exactly one test, `if (fanout.joined.has(extractor)) return` (:747). It reads neither the uri, nor `supportedUris`, nor `origin`. `extractors` is a mutable module singleton (:551, mutated at :683 and :719), so "every registered source" means every source registered when that loop runs: 24 today ([the registry](/tldr/sources/)), plus one per source a connected plugin registers.

On the MEDIA path every payload is dropped on the floor: rows reach the store down a side channel ([the write path](/tldr/write/)), the store emits `media:changed`, and the resolver re-reads the cluster and yields the aggregate (media/index.ts:81-87). Reading a source's answer says nothing about whether it answered: [the fan-out](/request/fan-out/).

## Self-selection

A source recognises itself by finding its own handle inside the uri it was handed: `extractAggregatedUriOrigin(uri, origin)` (utils/uri.ts:43-46), which picks the most specific match. Specificity is prefix extension, not length, so the guard carries the hyphen (`startsWith` of the id plus `-`, uri.ts:14-41): without it `cr:G24H1N3MP` beats `cr:G24H1N3MP-GS00374452` in every locale, and a 14 episode season page lists 24 rows.

*Crunchyroll answers one uri four ways, and only answer 4 mints a permanent SAME_AS claim.*

Three of the four are the same bytes, `{ media: null }`, so a refusal on shape and a source that found nothing upstream are indistinguishable. jikan is asked every time and refuses every aggregated uri: its gate is `!uri || !isUri(uri)` (jikan/extractor.ts:374) and `isUri` demands exactly two colon-separated parts (uri.ts:71-80), which no aggregate has. On a detail page its rows arrive through `mediaPage`. More at [self-selection](/request/self-selection/).

## What a source is allowed to spend

The root operation rides in the GraphQL variables (a header throws `Cannot convert argument to a ByteString` on user text; urql's operation context does not vary the operation key). Only `token` is read off the wire, and `rootId`, `operation` and `chain` are regenerated from the worker's `hops` registry, so a plugin rewriting them changes nothing (src/worker/request-context.ts:118-127).

| operation | `crossSource` | what it buys | what it costs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MEDIA` | true | justwatch turns a `/watch/` url into a Crunchyroll series id | a token plus a CMS request, per film result |
| `MEDIA_PAGE` | false | the offer keeps its url and loses only the identity claim | nothing on a results page reads that id |
| `SIMILAR_MEDIA` | true | `resolveSimilarRuns` proceeds (similar-consumer.ts:281) | never opened as a root; reachable from a test |
| absent | true, `UNKNOWN_POLICY` | today's behaviour, failing open | `misses++` is the only tell (request-context.ts:73, :125) |

Read in exactly two places: justwatch/extractor.ts:372 and similar-consumer.ts:281.

## The re-ask

The uri was captured at subscribe time and `Subscription.media` is yield-once with no retry, so a source whose id arrives a moment later already answered "not mine" and ended. `askUnasked(media.uri)` inside `read()` batches every newly named origin, and `askOrigins` opens a fresh subscription at the sources matching `answersForOrigins` (src/sources/supported.ts:27-29), which reads two sets: the origin a source publishes under, and the foreign origins it can be asked with. Conflating them kills anizip, which mints `anizip:` and answers from a mal id.

| bound | sources | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 asks | 22 of 24 | one opening ask, plus one for its own origin |
| 4 asks | anizip | `supportedUris = ['anidb', 'mal']` (anizip/extractor.ts:13) |
| 6 asks | offline | `['offline', ...INDEXED_ORIGINS]`, mal, anilist, kitsu, anidb (offline/extractor.ts:48, index-lookup.ts:20) |

`askedOrigins` is a ratchet and the `add` happens **before** `askOrigins` runs (media/index.ts:58-65), so an origin counts as asked whether the subscription started, the upstream answered, or the source threw. `supportedUris` decides who gets a second question, never what comes back: anizip declares `anidb` but its resolver reads only a mal handle (:120-126), so an anidb-only cluster spends a subscription and refuses. The re-ask is targeted rather than a blanket re-fan because nothing caches this: `useResponseCache` sits at ttl 15 minutes (worker/extractor.ts:470) and never fires, since @envelop/response-cache exposes `onExecute` only and all five call sites here are `.subscription(...)`.

*The request leaves the worker and only becomes a network call back on the page, so the seed refusal answers 404, never 503.*

`MAX_RETRIES` is 3 (backoff.ts:17), so four attempts, and `backoffDelay` adds 1s, 2s and 4s of latency with no `console` call anywhere in the module (:37-38). Which statuses buy a retry, and which deliberately do not, is at [/tldr/rules/](/tldr/rules/).

Exhaustion is asymmetric: four retryable statuses in a row end at `return response`, failing status and body intact (:75), four rejections at `throw error` (:71). Both shapes reach the caller, which is why `if (!response.ok) throw` is the only thing between a 503 body and `JSON.parse`. `withBackoff` has no idempotence test, so AniList's `method: 'POST'` (anilist/extractor.ts:287) is retried too, safe only because every POST here is a read. Retried bodies are cancelled, the last one is not (:77). Detail at [fetch and backoff](/request/fetch-and-backoff/).

Nothing comes back the way it went out: the ask is a trigger, the answers are rows, and the page learns what it asked for by re-reading the store. What a source is allowed to put in those rows, and what it must prove before minting an identity claim, is [what a source may claim](/tldr/sources/).
