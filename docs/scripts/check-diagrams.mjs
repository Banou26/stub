// builds perfectly and then renders as an empty box, or as mermaid's own error graphic, for every
// reader. The only check that can see that is one that loads the page and looks for the <svg>.
//
// Reads its page list from the sitemap the build already writes, so a new page is covered the moment
// it exists rather than when someone remembers to add it here.

// Resolves `playwright` by walking up to the stub repo's node_modules, which is why this file lives
// under docs/ and still runs: an ESM specifier resolves against the file's own location.
